question: "Why not work on urgent problems like climate and health?"
---

Materials and manufacturing may seem removed from the world's most important problems: war, poverty, inequality, climate change, sickness, and death. But materials and manufacturing are _upstream of all these problems_. The time and money that we pour into therapeutics and carbon removal are not a complete waste, but without entirely new ways to rearrange atoms, materials to contain fission and fusion power, and new ways to make technology that breaks us out of our hyper-optimized and fragile paradigms, there are diminishing returns to work that directly attacks big problems.

_The history of technology is dominated by second-order effects:_ we solved many huge problems not by working on them directly, but by creating powerful technologies -- the Haber-Bosch process, steel, electricity, refrigeration, and beyond. More broadly, new frontiers obsolete old problems, break us out of zero-sum games, and create human agency.
