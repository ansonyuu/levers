question: "Isn't speculative research the government's job?"
---

Government-funded research has resulted in many breakthroughs and we are certainly not trying to _replace_ it! However, like any institutional structure, government research has constraints. Specifically, government research in a democracy faces a fundamental tension: taxpayers want governments to be responsible with their money, but great research requires speculative bets. We can take risks without leaving the taxpayer on the hook for it.

There's no "natural" role for governments to do research. While governments funding the majority of research is just "the way things work" today, that has only been the case for less than a century.

More broadly, no single institution can support all eventually-good ideas. Institutional pluralism is important so that ideas that fall outside of that institution's constraints have a home.
