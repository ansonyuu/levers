question: "Isn't there plenty of research on materials and manufacturing processes already?"
---

It's true that both corporations and academia do a lot of research on materials and manufacturing. There are entire departments devoted to them!

However, the sort of research work that is happening isn't the kind of work that will unlock big technological shifts:

- Academic work focuses on only the most interesting and novel part of the problem: showing proofs-of-principle, usually in one component of a larger system.

- Industrial work primarily focuses on improvements within an existing system or business model.

Breakthroughs in materials and manufacturing require creating new systems that can scale. The work to make materials and manufacturing systems scale can require as much research as inventing the system in the first place, but doesn't lead to exciting papers (and thus, goes against academic incentives). At the same time, new materials and manufacturing processes often require new business models and have worse performance than existing systems out of the gate. Both of these properties make earnest efforts to scale and use unproven systems unappealing to most corporations.

So while there is plenty of research on materials and manufacturing processes, there is a critical gap that we are trying to fill.
