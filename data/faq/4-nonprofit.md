question: "Why are you a nonprofit?"
---

One might expect an organization that creates valuable technology to be structured around capturing that technology's value. There are many examples of startups or incubators that have successfully created technologies and brought them to market. Profit also creates a tight feedback loop and makes organizations auto-catalyzing.

Despite these advantages, we are structured as a nonprofit because it is structurally hard to capture value from the systems-research style work we do and by setting out to capture the value we create, we believe we would ultimately hamstring the technologies.

Furthermore, even if DARPA could capture [a 1% fraction of the value of the entire internet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zI_Q2Sx6OduWOXkVzCTjcr2FGA-_83eK3y7LKpQzJdY/edit?usp=sharing), it would not have a positive return. We believe that brutal honesty is the best policy and that we would be deceiving investors if we promised them anything beyond a low probability of modest returns.
