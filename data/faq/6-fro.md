question: "How are your programs different from focused research organizations?"
---

There are many similarities between [Focused Research Organizations](https://www.dayoneproject.org/ideas/focused-research-organizations-to-accelerate-science-technology-and-medicine/) (FROs) and private ARPA-style programs: both focus on things that don't fit into academia or startups, both leverage empowered leaders, both aim towards clear goals.

However, there are key differences between "ARPA shaped ideas" and "FRO-shaped ideas:

- FROs

  - Clear goal from day one

  - Tight coupling between work-streams from day one

  - Strong conviction about the right approach at the project level early on

  - Most work done under one organizational roof, outsourcing routine aspects to contractors but not widely distributing the fundamental research questions.

  - Quickly ramp up to $10-50m range to focus on scalable execution not achievable in existing organizational settings.

- PARPA

  - Might take 6 months to a year to nail down a goal

  - Projects are initially parallel with coupling increasing over time

  - Unclear about the right approach

  - Naturally leverages existing organizations and forms networks among them to develop new system level ideas, approaches or concepts.
