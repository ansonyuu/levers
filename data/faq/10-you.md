We’re working with excellent [program managers](http://spec.tech/team) who have ambitious visions and deeply understand how research works while being intimately familiar with the limitations of the current system.

We’ve assembled a group of [top-tier advisors and donors](http://spec.tech/team) who understand what we’re going for and will both push us to be pragmatic but not to deviate from the broader mission.

Ben, Speculative Technologies’ founder has worked across the research ecosystem: PhD in academia working with NASA’s Chief Technologist on tractor beams for space robots, visiting researcher at NASA, computer vision at a unicorn startup trying to build drastically new technology, starting a startup, and venture capital. He’s written a heavily-cited analysis of how DARPA works that is directly influencing how Speculative Technologies works.
