question: "Why now?"

The problems we're addressing are not new. The realization that something is amiss with our innovation ecosystem is more than a decade old. Tyler Cowen published his book "The Great Stagnation" in 2011. That same year Founders Fund adopted their now-famous tagline "We were promised flying cars, instead we got 140 characters."

At the time though, a widely held view was that high-growth startups were the solution. After all, Silicon Valley had begun to disrupt media, shopping, transportation, and many other industries. Nominally, they did this by building technology so it was natural to assume that high-growth startups would soon do the same for materials, manufacturing, and research more generally.

One _why now_ is that enough time has passed to make it clear that we need more than ambitious startups to improve the innovation ecosystem. By and large, the story of ambitious, researchy startups building general-purpose technologies is that they either go out of business, are acquired for talent, or pivot towards profitable niches. It has become clear that we need something beyond startups.

Additionally, recent events have exposed the cracks in many systems:

- There are many talented people trained in the hard sciences or engineering disciplines who want to do hard, impactful, research work but (reasonably) opt out of academia and its tiny number of professor positions compared to the postdocs who want to fill them, bureaucracy, publish or perish, and more. People have realized that they could be doing so much more than data science or SaaS startups.

- COVID and Ukraine-driven supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions have made it clear that there is a lot of important work to be done in materials and manufacturing to make more robust systems.

- The pandemic also revealed that relatively small interventions could have a large impact on our sclerotic research system. Fast Grants, premised on the simple idea that a fast turnaround time on grant decisions could unlock research that wouldn't otherwise happen, was able to get hundreds of COVID-related projects off the ground that would otherwise have been stuck in limbo.

To some extent, the answer is also "vibes." Many people have realized that the innovation ecosystem and old institutions more generally are not working as well as they once did. While perhaps not the consensus position, there's a growing perception that we need new institutions.
