question: "Doesnâ€™t this take a lot of money? Where does it come from?"

Physical research is expensive --- we expect a single five year program to cost approximately $10M. If these programs are actually high-risk (say, a 10% chance of success) it will cost $70M over at least five years to run enough programs to have a 50% chance of a single success.

These numbers are large in an absolute sense, they are cheap compared to other research funding: 0.2% of the [NSF's budget](https://www.nsf.gov/about/congress/119/highlights/cu22.jsp), 0.04% of the [philanthropic dollars spent on science per year](https://physicsworld.com/a/us-philanthropic-organisations-spend-over-30bn-a-year-on-science/), and 0.001% of the [amount spent by the US government on R&D](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/us-federal-scientific-research-and-development-budget-overview-and-outlook).

In version 1.0 we are depending on donations from foundations and individuals. In the long run, we're exploring several options that could bring in more consistent funding and hopefully make us autocatalytic. While it is far from our core goal, the best way to get some of our technology into the world will be through licensed IP or spun-out startups. Another approach is to build a research consortium similar to the Semiconductor Research Corporation.
