question: "How are you different from DARPA?"
---

There are three major differences:

- _We have different mandates:_ ours is to build the future through new materials and manufacturing processes; theirs is to "prevent strategic surprise." While DARPA's mandate is broad, it still needs to justify all the work it does in terms of national defense.

- _We answer to different stakeholders:_ DARPA is still a government agency. Despite having lower bureaucratic overhead than most parts of the US government, DARPA is still answerable to the Department of Defense, Congress, and the American taxpayer more broadly. Those stakeholders demand a certain set of justifications. We have our own stakeholders: our donors, employees (and we like to think) humanity more broadly. These stakeholders still demand justifications, but a different kind.

- _We have different constraints:_ DARPA has a budget that is orders of magnitude larger than ours. As a result, they're able to take on more expensive work. At the same time, we have many fewer constraints on how fast we can move and the sorts of "institutional moves" we can make. There's nothing stopping Speculative Technologies from writing a check the day we decide to fund a project or giving money to an unincorporated team working out of a garage if they're doing good work.
