# Levers for Progress

*A Living Database of Methods to Accelerate Science and Technology*

*By Anson Yu and Kelvin Yu (not siblings and not married)*

### **Motivation**

Levers for Progress is an open-source collection of **policies, tactics, and reforms** used by modern institutions to accelerate innovation in the US.

For each lever, we explain how it works, its significance, potential pitfalls, and provide case studies. Our goal is to provide an overview of ways for governments, companies, philanthropies, universities, foundations, and other institutions to increase their scientific and technological output.

We acknowledge the project’s title is a bit of a misnomer. If progress is [real](https://jamesclear.com/book-summaries/lessons-of-history#:~:text=If%20progress%20is%20real%2C%20it,larger%20portion%20of%20human%20heritage.), it’s certainly not concentrated in only beakers, labs, and factories. Carving a holistic political, philosophical, and cultural definition for civilizational progress is a grand challenge. We leave that undertaking to braver souls.

We chose to focus on science and technology because, despite their measurable, material, and scalable improvements on quality of life, we as a culture do not properly appreciate or support their role in enabling lives of greater prosperity. Not in Washington, where underfunded government scientists work out of [crumbling](https://www.facilitiesnet.com/maintenanceoperations/tip/NIST-Facilities-Crumbling-Under-Maintenance-Backlog--51178) buildings. Not in education, where US students have [underachieved](https://www.csis.org/blogs/perspectives-innovation/us-should-strengthen-stem-education-remain-globally-competitive#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20is%20falling%20behind%20in%20STEM%20proficiency%20compared%20to%20other%20leading%20countries) in STEM for decades. Not even in Silicon Valley, which tends to sneer at academia and government, [forgetting](https://www.energy.gov/articles/75-breakthroughs-americas-national-laboratories-0) that research from universities and national labs underpin much of society.

This was not always the case. We started the Manhattan Project less than a century ago, the Apollo missions sixty years ago, and even declared war on cancer fifty years ago. We inexplicably lost this ethos—and only began recovering it in the last few years. The rest of this letter explains this history, but if you’d like to skip to the levers that helped rekindle this spirit, you can head [here](https://www.notion.so/Levers-for-Progress-The-Database-522830f5450740499c6b91a3febc973c?pvs=21).

### **The Rise and Fall of Technological Statecraft**

Starting in the early 2010s, a small group of [economists](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-eSpecial-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS) and [entrepreneurs](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Xqcorq5EyJBpZcCrN/thiel-on-progress-and-stagnation) began promoting the “stagnation hypothesis”: that scientific, technological, and economic progress has slowed significantly in recent decades.

Dr. Robert Gordon’s [book](https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-American-Growth-Princeton/dp/153661825X) *The Rise and Fall of American Growth* observes that 1870-1970 witnessed unprecedented improvements in people’s lives, driven by inventions like the electric grid, internal combustion engine and cars, all [modern appliances](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/how-appliance-boom-moved-more-women-workforce), an Agricultural Revolution, global peace secured by nuclear weapons, the rapid expansion of modern medicine, and more. The greatest inventions of recent decades—computers and the Internet—[have not](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/) had the same scale of uplifting effects on wages, physical labor, and health. Even science itself is showing [diminishing returns](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/).

Fears of stagnation are not new in the modern West. John Keynes [wrote](http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/econ116a/keynes1.pdf) in 1930, *“We are suffering just now from a bad attack of economic pessimism. It is common to hear people say that the epoch of enormous economic progress which characterized the nineteenth century is over.”*

Fifteen years and a world war later, Vannevar Bush—Roosevelt and Truman’s chief science advisor—[lamented](https://archive.is/ezrwO#selection-1533.1-1533.455) the way science was evolving: *“The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers—conclusions which he cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial.”*

Bush followed his comments by instrumenting the [Endless Frontier](https://www.nature.com/articles/466922a) era — technological statecraft at a scale never before seen in history. The Greatest Generation recognized science and technology were paramount to US victory in WWII and would continue to be for its ascendancy, so they poured [1.86%](https://ncses.nsf.gov/data-collections/national-patterns) of GDP into R&D by 1964 (3x higher than today’s federal R&D budget). Most of today’s major scientific institutions were created during this [golden age](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.ea.23.050195.000245), including the NSF to be the central hub for research, NASA to explore the frontiers of space, and DARPA to garrison national security. We also dramatically expanded the National Institutes of Health to push the limits of biology and created programs that would later meld into the Department of Energy. The word “innovation” [became synonymous](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303428207_Innovation_contested_The_idea_of_innovation_over_the_centuries#:~:text=Only%20after%20World%20War%20II%20did%20the%20concept%20of%20innovation%20become%20almost%20exclusively%20reduced%20to%20technological%20and%20entrepreneurial%20developments) with technology during this time.

Cultural narratives about technology took a darker turn in the 1960s and 70s. Left-wing humanists [argued](https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/andrew-jewett-science-under-fire/#:~:text=increasingly%20argued%20that%20science%E2%80%99s%20cultural%20influence%20buttressed%20social%20inequalities%2C%20keeping%20favored%20groups%20in%20power%20and%20others%20down) that science’s “cultural influence buttressed social inequalities, keeping favored groups in power and others down.” The emerging Christian Right [saw](https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/andrew-jewett-science-under-fire/#:~:text=Christian%20Right%20focused%20on%20the%201960s.%20Proponents%20of%20each%20narrative%20have%20discerned%20a%20pervasive%20sense%20of%20moral%20aimlessness%20that%20they%20often%20linked%20to%20the%20cultural%20influence%20of%20science.) technology threatening traditional virtues and ways of living. These overlapping revolts gradually dismantled technological ambition from politics, of science from the state.

The final nail in the coffin came with the end of the Cold War. Without a geopolitical rival, R&D was recast from a positive-sum priority for external security to a zero-sum competition for domestic appropriations. In response to the 1993 [termination](https://archive.is/NzbSU#selection-1719.0-1719.161) of the Superconducting Super Collider after Congress already invested $2 billion, Nobel Laureate Steven Weinberg stated:

*“Spending for the SSC had become a target for a new class of Congressmen elected in 1992. They were eager to show that they could cut what they saw as Texas pork, and they didn’t feel that much was at stake. The Cold War was over, and discoveries at the SSC were not going to produce anything of immediate practical importance.*

*What motivates legislators is the immediate economic interests of their constituents. Big laboratories bring jobs and money into their neighborhood, so they attract the active support of legislators from that state, and apathy or hostility from many other members of Congress.*

*The Clinton administration decided that it could only support one large technological project in Texas, and it chose the Space Station. The Space Station had the great advantage that it cost about ten times more than the SSC, so that NASA could spread contracts for its development over many states. **Perhaps if the SSC had cost more, it would not have been canceled.**”*

Instead, the world’s flagship particle accelerator was built in Europe. Research fell out of fashion as a federal priority. Following Milton’s neoliberal doctrine, the government increasingly ceded technological inventions (and their supply chains) to the private sector and global markets. As a Bush I economics advisor famously [quipped](https://americancompass.org/potato-chips-computer-chips-yes-there-is-a-difference/), "computer chips, potato chips, what’s the difference?"

### **The Roots of Revival**

Close observers of science and technology may have noticed past headwinds reversing in recent years, fueled by an unlikely intersection of movements.

Industrial policy, once a [dirty phrase](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40722344) in American politics, has gained bipartisan traction in Washington. Efforts to build better roads, counter China, and deploy faster clean energy have resulted in $2 trillion of [infrastructure](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/24/1009923468/heres-whats-included-in-the-infrastructure-deal-that-biden-struck-with-senators), [technology](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/the-chips-and-science-act-heres-whats-in-it), and [climate](https://thefulcrum.us/Government/Congress/inflation-reduction-act) investments.

This ethos to build and innovate is present in economic philosophies emerging across the political spectrum. On the left, [abundance agendists](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/scarcity-crisis-college-housing-health-care/621221/) and [supply-side progressives](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/opinion/supply-side-progressivism.html) like Ezra Klein urge liberals to “take innovation as seriously as affordability.” On the right, deregulation and innovation have become calling cards for reversing the [spiraling costs](https://www.niskanencenter.org/cost-disease-socialism-how-subsidizing-costs-while-restricting-supply-drives-americas-fiscal-imbalance/) of core social goods and [recatalyzing](https://americancompass.org/should-the-u-s-adopt-an-industrial-policy/#:~:text=The%20second%20point%2C%20and%20in%20my%20mind%2C%20probably%20the%20central%20one%2C%20is%20innovation%20and%20productivity.) long-term economic growth. Technolibertarian flavors also appear in Silicon Valley, with calls to restore “[American Dynamism](https://a16z.com/2022/01/14/building-american-dynamism-2/).”

Allegations of stagnation have also become less heterodox. A 2019 [petition](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/) by Stripe CEO Patrick Collison and economist Tyler Cowen for “a new science of progress” ignited the [Progress Studies](https://www.notion.so/Progress-Studies-101-7089d11646d144928ded1274e1b03755?pvs=21) community, which seeks to investigate why scientific and technological progress happens and how to make it happen faster. Critiques of the scientific process have led to the [growth](https://www.biotechniques.com/technology-news/the-rise-of-metascience/) of [metascience](https://scienceplusplus.org/metascience/), the field of research on how to improve the scientific process itself.

Many new institutions have emerged from these intellectual strands. The NSF’s $300M [Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships](https://beta.nsf.gov/tip/latest) directorate, the DoD’s [Office of Strategic Capital](https://www.youtube.com/live/zNeSoU0f5fI?feature=share) and [Defense Innovation Unit](https://www.diu.mil/about), and the UK’s £800M [Advanced Research + Invention Agency](https://www.aria.org.uk/) aim to unshackle innovation from traditional bureaucracies. Schmidt Futures, Stripe, Open Philanthropy, Arnold Ventures, and other funders are experimenting with new ways of doing science, incubating and backing projects like [Convergent Research](https://www.convergentresearch.org/), [Frontier Climate](https://frontierclimate.com/), [Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/), and [Speculative Technologies](https://spec.tech/). A slew of publications such as [Roots of Progress](https://rootsofprogress.org/), [Works in Progress](http://worksinprogress.co/), and [Faster Please!](https://fasterplease.substack.com/) document critical lessons from the history of science and technology. Think tanks like the [Federal of American Scientists](https://fas.org/), [Institute for Progress](https://progress.institute/), and the [Day One Project](https://www.dayoneproject.org/) translate ideas into policies, resulting in the creation of [ARPA-H](https://www.dayoneproject.org/ideas/creating-the-health-advanced-research-projects-agency-harpa/), NSF’s TIP—the first NSF directorate to be created in almost 30 years—and other new departments with a mandate to innovate.

These groups all place science and technology at the heart of national prosperity — and recognize our agency in determining the future.

What led to this nationwide emphasis on science and technology not seen in decades? This question deserves an in-depth exploration of its own, but some driving forces include:

- **Intensifying geopolitical competition** makes leadership in dual-use technologies critical to safeguarding economic and national security interests
- **Rising costs of core social goods** such as healthcare, higher education, and housing are becoming prohibitive for middle and lower classes
- **Decades of offshoring manufacturing** have produced supply chain vulnerabilities, workforce dislocation, and loss of know-how
- **Global challenges demanding R&D at scale** are becoming more prevalent. Covid highlighted the life-saving stakes of fast R&D. Climate change presents global risks for energy and food insecurity. Emerging [biological weapons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153315/) require better methods for detection and protection than we currently have available.

Of course, material innovation is not the best or only way to solve these problems. The easiest solution to reduce housing costs requires zero science or technology—we can simply [update zoning laws](https://harvardlawreview.org/print/vol-135/addressing-challenges-to-affordable-housing-in-land-use-law/#:~:text=Restrictive%20zoning%20rules%2C%20like%20single%2Dfamily%20zoning%2C%20reduce%20the%20supply%20of%20land%20available%20for%20new%20housing%2C%20which%20in%20turn%20inflates%20the%20cost%20of%20new%20housing%20projects) to allow more housing projects. Similarly, healthcare costs could be reduced through policy maneuvers alone, perhaps by [removing artificial limits](https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2022/02/16/physician-shortage#:~:text=In%201981%2C%20a,residency%20training%20programs.) on physician supply or [redesigning](https://www.vox.com/2015/9/25/9397069/bernie-sanders-drug-prices) the drug patent system.

*“Science can be effective in the national welfare only as a member of a team, whether the conditions be peace or war. But without scientific progress no amount of achievement in other directions can insure our health, prosperity, and security as a nation in the modern world."* — [Vannevar Bush](https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm#:~:text=Science%20can%20be%20effective%20in,nation%20in%20the%20modern%20world.)

### **A Timely Collection**

Most existing scholarship about innovation resides in business school case studies. Their goal is limited to comprehension, to explain why one organization succeeded where others failed. Our goal is to take the next step—to help organizations replicate the systemic factors that lead to outperformance in innovation. As Patrick Collison and Tyler Cowen [call out](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/#:~:text=Organizations%20as%20varied,of%20human%20organizations):

*“Organizations as varied as Y Combinator, MIT’s Radiation Lab, and ARPA have astonishing track records in catalyzing progress far beyond their confines. These examples collectively indicate that one of our highest priorities should be figuring out interventions that increase the efficacy, productivity, and innovative capacity of human organizations.”*

Through our work and reading, we’ve come across some deeply inspiring organizations, interventions, and experiments. Our goal is that by aggregating these levers into an easily accessible directory, we can help institutions of all kinds—including federal and local governments, universities, funding agencies, philanthropies, and companies—take inspiration and replicate them faster.

Welcome to Levers for Progress.
