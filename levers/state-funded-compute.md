## Key things to know

- Many advanced scientific experiments and engineering feats, such as simulating dark matter, modeling the climate, and building frontier AI models, require a greater computational power than normal universities or companies can afford or build themselves
- It should be no surprise, then, that the [top 500 supercomputers](https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/2023/06/) are all heavily or entirely state-funded. As of July 2023, the Department of Energy’s Frontier supercomputer at Oak Ridge national lab ranks #1 in the world in computing capacity; in May 2022, it became the first computer to achieve exascale computing (can perform a billion billion calculations per second). As of July 2023, Frontier [represents](https://archive.li/kPMpj#selection-613.90-613.158) a quarter of the computing power of the top 500 supercomputers in the world.
  - [Inflection.ai](http://Inflection.ai), a leading AI startup, recently raised $1.3B to build what will be the third-largest computing cluster in the world (behind Frontier and the soon-to-be-finished [Aurora](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/high-performance-computing/supercomputing/exascale-computing.html)) comprising 22,000 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs. CoreWeave also raised hundreds of millions to build an [AI supercomputer](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/coreweave-secures-2-3-billion-debt-financing-facility-led-by-magnetar-capital-and-blackstone-to-meet-surging-demand-and-ongoing-expansion-of-specialized-cloud-infrastructure-to-power-ai-301892706.html). The recent AI frenzy has created enough demand for private capital to fund large-scale computing projects, but given sheer costs and industry consolidation it’s unlikely many more huge private clusters will be built.
- State-funded computing power will only grow as a vector of national and global importance over the coming decade. AI—and all the science enabled by frontier computing—will increasingly become vital to national security and economic vitality. China has been investing heavily in high-performance computing centers over the [last few years](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3217499/china-aims-build-supercomputer-internet-solve-industry-challenges) and will only continue to accelerate investment following increasing US [export controls](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/10/28/biden-china-semiconductors-chips/).
  - China has more supercomputers on the Top500 list than any other country in quantity, but they significantly lag behind the US in power.

## Case study

In light of the growing realization that large-scale computing was increasingly necessary for ‘big science,’ Congress passed the [Department of Energy High-End Computing Revitalization Act of 2004](https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/house-bill/4516/titles) to establish a portfolio of national high-performance computing facilities. In 2005 and 2006, the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) and the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) came online, housing some of the world’s most advanced computing resources, including supercomputers (e.g. the Frontier exascale computer), visualization clusters, advanced data storage systems, and high-performance networking capabilities.

The DOE opened up access to OCLF and ALCF through the Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (INCITE) program in 2006. INCITE aimed to accelerate progress on big science problems by providing merit-based access to the scientific community. Hundreds of proposals have been accepted since 2006, with discoveries in dark matter and supernova modeling, earthquake simulations, manufacturing optimization, protein design, and drug discovery.

In addition to furthering R&D, state-funded compute can be used for developing talent. Starting in 2022, INCITE began devoting 10% of its compute allocation to an “Early Career Track,” which [aims to](https://www.anl.gov/article/us-department-of-energys-incite-program-seeks-proposals-for-2024-to-advance-science-and-engineering) “encourage the next generation of high-performance computing researchers by focusing on principal investigators who have earned a doctorate degree within the last 10 years.” The 2023 [National AI Research Resource (NAIRR)](https://www.ai.gov/nairrtf/) proposal envisions creating public compute infrastructure for AI research and development training, especially for underserved institutions.
