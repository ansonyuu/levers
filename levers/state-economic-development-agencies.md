## Key things to know

- States spend billions every year on economic development activities that range from recruiting new businesses to helping local businesses expand. State economic development agencies are the entities that coordinate these initiatives.
- They serve an important middle layer of funding, with sufficient financial power to meaningfully shape development in a region, while still being nimble and localized enough to do the illegible work of coalition building and understanding local contexts that often federal funding organizations cannot, simply by virtue of their size.
- Traditionally, state economic development agencies craft incentive packages and work to attract businesses, including through megasite development and regional hub coordination. However, there is a growing model of state economic development agencies moving beyond these traditional incentive- and site-based roles towards funding innovation through startup incubators and building coalitions for regional innovation hubs.

## Case study

The Maryland Clean Energy Center (MCEC) is a corporate instrumentality of the state of Maryland, created by the Maryland state assembly in 2008 to provide financing for clean energy. Its main activity is serving as a green bank, specifically to finance Property Assessed Clean Energy loans for commercial buildings, which provides the majority of its revenue. Under the MCEC is also the Maryland Clean Energy Capital Program (MCECP) which provides project financing for clean energy projects. Finally, the MCEC also spun out the Maryland Energy Innovation Accelerator (MEIA) which serves as an incubator for University of Maryland-affiliated scientists and inventors, connecting them with executives-in-residence.

While the MCEC has a long history of providing mature financing options for clean energy properties, the MEIA is a good example of a state entity connecting university researchers to private capital. While it is still too early to tell how successful startups that come out of MEIA are, it is a good example of state entities providing coordination work earlier along the economic development pipeline. It should be noted that MCEC is a separate financing arm from the Maryland Economic Development Commission, which does more traditional economic development.

While this example focused on Maryland, other states like New York, California, and Massachusetts have equally robust economic development pipelines. In the climate space, [New York’s Innovation@NYSERDA](https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs), [California Energy Commission’s CalSEED program](https://calseed.fund/), and [Massachusetts Clean Energy Center’s IncubateMass](https://www.masscec.com/program/incubatemass) are examples of state energy agencies that have offices to incubate startups. These state energy agencies are also robust examples of state-level industrial policy: distributing rebates, grants, tax incentives; supporting workforce development; and crafting policies to aid the deployment of new energy technologies.

## Potential pitfalls

State economic development agencies require sufficient state capacity, careful due diligence, insulation from political pressure, and building on top of existing ecosystems. Without sufficient state capacity, economic development agencies cannot execute their missions, which can hurt due diligence and waste taxpayer dollars. Economic development agencies are catalysts that build on top of existing state resources, including an educated workforce, localized private capital, and progressive regulatory frameworks. Without strong fundamentals, it is difficult for state economic development agencies to succeed.

State economic development agencies that fixate on traditional incentives and ignore other economic development factors can drive up costs for state taxpayers, leading to bidding wars between states that subsidize corporations (the [Kansas-Missouri economic disputes](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-end-of-kansas-missouris-border-war-should-mark-a-new-chapter-for-both-states-economies/) being a good example). These races to the bottom, which focus on top-line dollar subsidies, ignore the importance of building strong fundamentals of state governance. The [renewed focus on qualify of life to attract businesses](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/improving-quality-of-life-not-just-business-is-the-best-path-to-midwestern-rejuvenation/), especially as remote and hybrid work arrangements surge, is an important reminder that funding innovation and cutting business deals are relevant strategies for well-functioning states, not a silver bullet for economic development.
