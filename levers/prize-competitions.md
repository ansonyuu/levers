## About the co-author

## Key things to know

- Competitions where contestants compete to demonstrate a specified capability. The winner can be a grant or guaranteed purchase of the winning solution
- Every US federal agency has the authority to support competitions up to $50 million. What if we required federal agencies to procure a certain percentage of their solutions

## When to use

Unclear — when is it preferable to other levers?

## Success case study

[From Day One Project](https://uploads.dayoneproject.org/2021/09/10150642/Industrial-Policy-Memo.pdf):

> For example, one [Ansari XPrize competition](https://www.xprize.org/) awarded a $10 million prize to a privately funded reliable, reusable spaceship able to carry three people into space (100 km above the Earth’s surface) two times within two weeks. Nearly 30 teams competed in the competition, investing a total of $100 million into finding a solution. The prize competition turned into an acquisition when the winner was licensed by Virgin Galactic—and the solution has become part of the commercial space-flight industry today

For years (113th and 115th Congress), Bernie Sanders has [proposed](https://archive.is/o/70ivz/https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s627/text) creating a $100 billion (0.55% of GDP) pharmaceutical prize pool. The system [would’ve](https://archive.is/70ivz#selection-841.362-845.232) rewarded companies that invented drugs that cured certain conditions, and those drugs would be immediately released without exclusive patent protections.
