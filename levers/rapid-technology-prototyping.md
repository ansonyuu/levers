## Key things to know

- A Rapid Technology Prototyping (RTP) program is an acquisition program that issues several contracts for small, fast, and cheap prototypes instead of relying on a single contractor to build one alpha-ready version
- This allows a federal agency to test functional research prototypes within a short period of time to assess the technology’s viability prior to substantial government investment
- Two key principles to successfully implementing a RTP are: **(1)** design the acquisition approach and the request for proposal (RFP) to be open, transparent, and clear so that it solicits a large number of proposals that fit the agency’s requirements and **(2)** the acquisition process needs to be expedited compared to traditional government procurement methods

## When to use

RTPs are viable when multiple contractors have the resources to build prototypes and the technical difficulty is low enough that minimum viable products (MVPs) can be built without large-scale investments.

## Case study

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC), which insures American bank deposits, launched a [Rapid Prototyping Competition](https://www.fdic.gov/about/advisory-committees/state-regulators/2020-10-14-agenda/2020-10-14-rapid-prototyping.pdf) in 2020 to develop a financial reporting platform for American banks to communicate real-time financial health information to the FDIC. The platform would have made it easier for regulators to spot systemic risks and bank runs, such as the issues that felled Silicon Valley Bank. The initiative died in 2022 due to skepticism about relying on private firms from the regulator’s new leadership after the 2020 election.

Jelena McWilliams, a Trump appointee and FDIC Chair in 2020, described the challenge the competition hoped to solve in an [op-ed](https://www.fdic.gov/news/editorials/call-report-makeover.html):

> More than 150 years ago, Congress mandated that banks provide quarterly reports to supervisors on the financial health of the banking industry. At the end of each quarter, banks collect between 1,400 and 2,400 data fields, and transfer it to the FDIC for aggregation and analysis. When I began serving as FDIC chairman two years ago, we charted an ambitious course for the development of new technological solutions both at the agency and across the banks we supervise. This agenda includes making these “call reports” obsolete.
>
> Here is the issue: On June 16, we reported on the health of over 5,000 FDIC-insured financial institutions at the end of the first quarter. The quarter was challenging for banks, but the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic would continue into the second quarter. Second-quarter results for the vast majority of banks will not come in until the end of July — 120 days after the quarter began. **If you were a doctor trying to assess a patient’s health, it would be preposterous to get the lab results four months later.**

The competition lasted [four phases](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-fdic-s-focus-on-regulatory-9202238/) before it was cut. In phase 1, the FDIC invited 30+ companies to submit concept papers for a system that would make regulatory financial reporting less burdensome for banks and to provide the FDIC with better data on industry health. The papers were evaluated by a panel of experts and awardees were selected to move on to phase 2. In phase 2, the candidates prototyped the concepts that they discussed in their papers. In phase 3, awardees developed functional minimum viable products (MVP). In summer 2021, the FDIC invited four final firms—Palantir, Novantas, PeerIQ, and S&P Global Market Intelligence—to advance into phase 4, which would partner the selected companies with FDIC’s new tech office, FDITech, to use their MVPs in pilot programs.

Then the program hit a wall. As one Reuter reporter [wrote](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/how-fdic-dropped-ball-picked-up-tab-2023-04-04/):

> McWilliams quit in 2022 after board director Marty Gruenberg, a Democrat-affiliated appointee, challenged her over the rules surrounding bank mergers and ultimately won her role. Gruenberg, on the FDIC board since 2005, did not support the rapid phased prototyping data project, fretting that it amounted to outsourcing supervision, according to people familiar with the situation. As a result, no bid was declared a winner. For all but the biggest banks, the FDIC continues to rely on quarterly snapshots known as “call reports,” and the findings of its on-the-ground inspectors.

FDITech also appears to have shut down—its [website](https://www.fdic.gov/fditech/index.html) is blank.

The 2020 project’s failure—and the fact it didn’t start years sooner—illustrate a few lessons:

- **Long-term projects need sustained political support.** [Lack of leadership continuity](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/31/business/jelena-mcwilliams-fdic-bank-regulator-resigns.html) was the number one cause of the initiative’s death.
- **Overcoming bureaucratic risk aversion requires an executive champion**. To overcome institutional inertia to update bureaucracies, the people in charge need to embrace change. The program could have continued if McWilliams was replaced by an equally advent champion of technological reform.
- **High senior employee retention creates cultural stagnation**. It is difficult to change an organization’s culture if those in power tend to stay put for decades. The Inspector General **[warned in February](https://www.fdicoig.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2023-02/TMPC%20Final%202-16-23_0.pdf)** that 64% of FDIC’s advanced IT experts will be retirement-eligible by 2027. At the executive level, the median length of employment is 26 years, based on the **[FDIC’s website](https://www.fdic.gov/about/leadership/)** and other publicly available sources. Insiders joke that the agency’s abbreviation stands for “Found Dead In Chair.”
- **Government salaries prevent fresh blood**. The best tech talent prefers to go to Wall Street and Silicon Valley. The FDIC’s poor technical capacity is reflected in its poor **[storage of passwords](https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/summary-announcements/fdics-security-controls-over-microsoft-windows-active-directory)**, **[inadequate adherence](https://www.fdicoig.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2023-02/AUD-23-001.pdf)** to tech protocols, and multiple overlapping internal systems, according to sources with [personal knowledge](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/how-fdic-dropped-ball-picked-up-tab-2023-04-04/#:~:text=say%20sources%20with-,personal%20knowledge,-%2C%20with%20multiple%20overlapping).
