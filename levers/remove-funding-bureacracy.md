This is a summary of [Dr. Willy Chertman’s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/willy-chertman-b15302a2) writings on institutional review boards and bureaucratic hindrances to medical research. Both articles are linked below.

## Key things to know

- Modern science necessarily requires bureaucracy to function. From [research security](https://www.aau.edu/key-issues/chips-and-science-act-summary-research-security-provisions) protocols to mitigate research theft to grant applications for research funding, scientists must engage with legal and social processes to conduct their work.
- However, many policies impose over-burdensome processes that reduce the amount of time and research dollars spent on scientific research. By [some estimates](https://acquisitiontalk.com/2021/12/top-researchers-spend-50-of-their-time-writing-grants-how-to-fix-it-and-what-it-means-for-dod/#:~:text=the%20academic%20sciences.-,By%C2%A0some%20estimates,-%2C%20many%20top%20researchers), top researchers spend 50% of their time writing grant applications.

## Case study

In biomedicine, the general pattern is that research scandals are vastly overblown by journalists, which causes politicians to call for more oversight and increases risk aversion by federal science agencies. While federal funding for biomedicine initially came with few strings attached, by the 1970s, high-profile biomedical research scandals in medicine had led to the creation of [institutional review boards](https://www.cspicenter.com/p/its-time-to-review-the-institutional) (IRBs).

IRBs are supervised (mostly) by the Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP), a small agency within the National Institutes of Health that, by revoking an IRB’s license to operate, can threaten entire institutions with a research freeze. As expected, IRBs became increasingly heavy-handed since their creation—and as Simon Whitney argues in his book *[From Oversight to Overkill: Inside the Broken System That Blocks Medical Breakthroughs—And How We Can Fix It](https://www.amazon.com/Oversight-Overkill-Inside-Medical-Breakthroughs/dp/1953943225)—*has significantly slowed medical research.

In the field of social science, as law professor [Philip Hamburger has argued,](https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/faculty_scholarship/487) IRBs effectively act as censorship boards. In medicine, the cost is counted in human lives. For example, estimates of the human toll of a more cumbersome U.S. consent process for just one trial—the [ISIS-2 trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC28530) of heart-attack treatments—range from [3,600 to 10,000](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2796.2011.02351_2.x) lives lost. And what of the trials that IRBs have discouraged from ever occurring?

In response to decades of criticism, OHRP instituted token reforms from 2011 to 2018, but the only substantive result of these efforts for biomedical researchers was to exempt a narrow category of research from the IRB review process and to allow a single IRB to supervise research over multiple institutions. The structures at the core of IRB dysfunction—its focus on risk over benefit, byzantine consent forms, and a lack of any appeal mechanism—remained untouched. Reform through the executive branch has thus proved unsuccessful.
