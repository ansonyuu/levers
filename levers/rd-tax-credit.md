## Key things to know

- R&D tax credits reduce an entity’s tax liability if they invest in designing or developing new technology
- The United States has a federal research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit amount that is calculated as a percentage of a company's eligible R&D expenses, as defined under [section 41](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/41) of the Internal Revenue Code. Eligible expenses include wages for qualified employees and expenses for supplies and equipment. Many other types of R&D tax credits exist, including ones tailored to specific industries or small-and-medium-sized businesses
  - [Studies](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/RL31181.pdf) of the R&E tax credit’s effectiveness have found that on average, one dollar of the R&D credit stimulated one dollar of additional private R&D investment from the 1980s to the early 1990s
- R&D tax credits can help create new markets for startups. Take battery manufacturing, a capital-intensive industry that most venture investors and Silicon Valley founders do not typically venture into. An R&D tax credit for this industry would improve net margins, which would attract late-stage investors to build more plants. This could create a large enough market of manufacturers that unlock new startup opportunities (e.g. battery design optimization tools).

## When to use

- **When direct R&D funding bills are not possible:** Tax credits are an effective way to incentivize private capital to invest in R&D without directly spending taxpayer dollars. Given the [budget constraints](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R47384.pdf) of the 118th Congress (2023-2024), any meaningful R&D bill will likely rely on tax credits as a primary instrument

- [Better suited](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/effectiveness-rd-tax-incentives-oecd-economies) for products close to commercialization while direct government funding (e.g. grants and procurement) is better for technologies with high technical risk

## Success case study

The Orphan Drug Act (ODA)of 1983 established a tax credit to encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases, which pharmaceutical companies were not incentivized to tackle given the small market size. The tax credit provides a 50% credit for eligible clinical trial costs related to developing drugs for rare diseases. Since the tax credit’s inception, [more than](https://archive.bio.org/articles/impact-orphan-drug-tax-credit-treatments-rare-diseases) 200 new orphan drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – compared with only 34 approved before 1983.

## Potential pitfalls

- The US’s foray into synthetic fuels in the 90s and early 2000s resulted in many failures, including the [Synthetic Fuels Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_Fuels_Corporation) and the [waste of billions in R&D tax credits](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/08/business/irs-challenges-two-makers-of-coal-derived-synthetic-fuel.html). This example underscores the risk of using tax credits on technologies with high technical risk.
- A 2019 [NBER paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26099/w26099.pdf) found that while R&D tax credits have a significant long-term impact on both the quantity and quality of entrepreneurship and new startup formation, the bulk of the effect materializes more than five years after the policy is enacted. Therefore, R&D tax credits should not be viewed as a silver bullet for states aiming to drive economic growth through entrepreneurship. Instead, these credits should be one piece of a larger set of patient and targeted policies.
- From a [CRS Report](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/RL31181.pdf) on the federal research tax credit:
  > While many lawmakers endorse the use of tax incentives to boost domestic business R&D investment, there is widespread agreement that the R&E credit could be more effective than it is.
  > Critics say that the credit’s effectiveness is diminished by several factors, including uneven and inadequate incentive effects, uncertainty about and disputes over the IRS’s administration of the credit, lack of full refundability for cash-strapped startup firms, insufficient targeting of R&D projects with relatively high social returns, and more generous R&D tax incentives in other countries
