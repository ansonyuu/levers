## Context

- Modern nations have occasionally faced emergencies that required rapid, large-scale R&D programs to find solutions. Viruses are one common example—H1N1, Ebola, and Covid-19 being recent cases. Climate issues are another; the 1985 discovery of the ozone hole sparked fast R&D to find alternatives for the chemical culprits that caused it.
- This page provides a short case study of Operation Warp Speed (OWS), by many measures the most successful government R&D program in a generation. It accelerated the development and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines in record time, although it carried a number of flaws as well. Understanding the wins and challenges of this program will help policymakers replicate its principles for the next rapid response R&D program.

## Case Study: Operation Warp Speed

America entered Covid lockdown in March 2020. Two months later, Trump announced Operation Warp Speed (OWS) to “produce and deliver 300 million doses of safe and effective vaccines with the initial doses available by January 2021.” Due to the typical 5-10 years it takes to develop a vaccine, there was a [strong consensus](https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/544175-getting-the-facts-right-on-operation-warp-speed/#:~:text=Consider%20some%20typical%20examples) of experts, media, and prediction markets that were highly skeptical of OWS.

_[The lightning-fast quest for COVID vaccines — and what it means for other diseases | Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03626-1)_

Less than a year after the US entered lockdown, the first vaccines were administered in December 2020. The OWS fell short of its initial goals—distributing [50 million](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-01-31-21/h_1193af5dd1d7cb1a2dcb6c41c1a5ab63) vaccine doses by the end of Jan 2021 (instead of 300 million), but nonetheless beat the [previous record](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03626-1) for vaccine development by ~three years. This unique success among many government R&D programs comes from OWS’s strong public-private partnerships, effective coordination mechanisms, and command leadership structure. Future programs can learn from the key mechanisms behind OWS’s triumph, which are detailed in a recent [report](https://fas.org/publication/how-to-operation-warp-speed/) by the Federal of American Scientists and summarized here:

- **Ensure that the OWS model is the right fit for the problem.** In order to mobilize all of the government’s resources for a rapid R&D response, there must be broad consensus across stakeholders in the public, the government, and industry on both the problem and the solution. Furthermore, rapid solutions R&D is only possible when there is already established fundamental research. The mRNA vaccine platform that led to the first successful COVID-19 vaccines had been extensively studied by scientists prior to the pandemic (with DARPA [funding](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/covid-19)!)ˇ
- **Establish a single, cohesive leadership team across participating federal agencies.** Interagency collaboration is often difficult due to differences in their respective missions and politics, so simply tasking agency leaders with working together is insufficient. OWS created its own leadership team consisting of personnel from both federal agencies and the private sector. The inclusion of private sector personnel enabled the team to overcome agency biases and draw from industry experience in program operations.
- **Coordinate between federal regulators and the private sector to accelerate R&D.** During OWS, direct lines of communication between the FDA and vaccine companies allowed vaccine developers to continuously send data to the FDA to review while they were running clinical trials rather than waiting till the end. The FDA also permitted vaccine developers to run clinical trial stages in parallel and begin manufacturing before full demonstration of vaccine safety and efficacy, resulting in a significantly compressed timeline
- **Activate latent private-sector capabilities from labor to infrastructure to supply chains.** Rapid manufacturing of a large volume of products in a short time frame requires a significant workforce, infrastructure, and supply chain. Policymakers can tap into domestic labor forces by borrowing and retraining workers from other industries. For roles that can’t be easily filled, policymakers can expedite visa approvals for foreign talent. Existing manufacturing infrastructure and supply chains can be repurposed or redirected to the effort using the Defense Production Act. The Army Corps of Engineers can also conduct construction projects to further expand manufacturing capacity.
- **Use market-shaping mechanisms to de-risk the private sector.** Agencies with Other Transactions Authority have the power to use creative procurement mechanisms to create a market for a solution prior to its development and motivate the private sector to invest in rapid R&D. Examples of market-shaping mechanisms, also known as demand-pull mechanisms, include volume guarantees, advanced purchase agreements, advanced market commitments, prize competitions, challenge-based acquisitions, and milestone payments.
- **Diversify your portfolio and establish redundancies to minimize risk.** Engaging multiple private partners to tackle the same problem enables healthy competition and increases the likelihood that at least one will succeed success. OWS funded six vaccine companies to work on three different vaccine platforms, two for each. On the manufacturing side, contracts were awarded to multiple producers of vaccination supplies to reduce the risk of failure at any single node of the supply chain.

The program was not all roses and daisies, however. Significant [distribution challenges](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/17/crash-landing-of-operation-warp-speed-459892) gripped the program in the final days of the Trump administration. Some of the issues future policymakers can learn from include:

- **Coordination and communication gaps between federal and state officials**. The Trump administration [gave much](https://time.com/5932028/vaccine-rollout-joe-biden/) of the responsibility to distributing the vaccine to the states, but many local health officials felt they didn’t receive sufficient funding or resources to do so effectively. OWS’s head of logistics initially [overestimated](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/19/coronavirus-vaccine-overcount-warp-speed-448692#:~:text=Operation%20Warp%20Speed%20originally%20estimated%20up%20to%207.3%20million%20doses%20could%20be%20available%20in%20the%20second%20week%20of%20vaccine%20distribution.%20Instead%2C%20about%204.3%20million%20shots%20are%20ready%20%E2%80%94%20a%20discrepancy%20that%20has%20left%20governors%20scrambling%20to%20revise%20their%20vaccination%20plans.) the number of vaccines that states would have available to them by 70%, causing governors to revamp their plans last minute. The administration then changed policies to tell states how many doses they would receive one week at a time to prevent states from counting on supplies before they were ready, but this made it [near-impossible](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-operation-warp-speed-created-vaccination-chaos) to plan ahead.
- **Supply chain consolidation and lobbyists; value technical due diligence.** Emergent BioSolutions was awarded $628M to manufacture Covid vaccines, but after botching hundreds of millions of doses, the Biden administration canceled their contract. [Many concerns](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/20/congressional-investigation-launched-into-emergent-biosolutions-federal-vaccine-contracts-.html) were raised about Emergent’s deep lobbying relationships gave it an unfair advantage in being selected for the contract over more technically competent alternatives. In addition, Emergence [acquired](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/before-the-pandemic-top-contractor-received-billions-from-government-to-help-prepare-the-nation-for-biowarfare/2020/06/17/38d9ad3a-a41b-11ea-8681-7d471bf20207_story.html#:~:text=The%20industry%20consolidation,such%20as%20vaccines.) many competitors over the past decade to become the US’s sole provider of anthrax vaccine in the Strategic National Stockpile, which officials warned of creating a single point of failure.
- **Failure to manage communications with external experts and the public.** Communications were not included within the scope of OWS. Consequently, the initial skepticism of medical experts, who were not aware of OWS’s unique R&D strategy and regulatory accommodations, undermined public confidence in the ultimate vaccines. Opportunistic actors seized on the disagreement between experts and the government to sow further misinformation. Future rapid R&D initiatives that require individual adoption of solutions should include a proactive communications strategy to both external experts and the public to ensure public buy-in.
