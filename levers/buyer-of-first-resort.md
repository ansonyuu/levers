## Key things to know

- A buyer of first resort is an entity that is willing to be the first purchaser of new technologies. Government agencies and militaries are common buyers of first resort because they have the resources and willingness to invest in high-risk, high-reward technologies that could provide strategic advantages.
- The existence of a BoFR in a market frees companies with early-stage prototypes to invest in continual improvements and apply their technologies in potentially risky ways (e.g. transistors for space travel, as detailed below). Without one, companies may feel pressured to commercialize prematurely.

## Success case studies

The following series of quotes illustrate how the US military’s role as a BoFR for titanium catalyzed and grew the industry. They are taken from a recent analysis by Brian Potter. For the full-length post, you can check it out [here](https://www.construction-physics.com/p/the-story-of-titanium).

> As late as 1945, there was no commercial production of titanium, and the metal only existed in tiny amounts in labs. But 20 years later, it formed the literal backbone of the most advanced aerospace technology on the planet.
>
> Titanium was first discovered in 1790, but a commercially viable process for producing it wasn’t developed until the 1930s. William Knoll, a Luxembourg scientist, began experimenting with the metal in 1930, and by 1938 he successfully produced 50 pounds of titanium and successfully formed it into wires, rods, sheets, and plating. Kroll came to the US in 1938 to attempt to sell his process, but was unsuccessful.
>
> That same year, the US Bureau of Mines began to investigate titanium, in response to promising studies of its properties performed by the Philips Corporation (which had developed its own process for producing titanium). The Bureau of Mines concluded the Kroll process had the most potential as a commercial process and began to develop it. By 1947, it had successfully scaled up Kroll’s process, and had produced two tons of titanium “sponge,” a porous, spongy metal created by the process, which is melted down to produce bars, sheets, wires, etc.
>
> A 1948 study by the Bureau concluded that titanium was nearly as strong as stainless steel, weighed 40% less, was also incredibly corrosion-resistant, and maintained much more strength at elevated temperatures compared to aluminum. This made it potentially very useful for aerospace applications, where weight was at a premium and materials were often exposed to high temperatures.
>
> The Army, Navy, and Air Force labs closely followed this work. To try to kickstart the industry, the Air Force encouraged manufacturers to substitute steel with titanium, and the Army Ordnance Corporation placed an order for $1 million worth of titanium metal.
>
> In the press, titanium began to be called “the wonder metal," “the miracle metal," and the “Cinderella metal” (because it had been overlooked for so long). An executive for a company producing titanium noted that “Sensational magazine articles predicted that titanium would become the miracle metal-for spacecraft, ‘atomic furnaces,’ airplanes of all kinds, submarines, railroad tracks, truck bodies, portable bridges” (Rowley 1972). Between 1950 and 1952, more than two dozen companies announced plans to produce titanium.
>
> But the nascent titanium industry struggled. In 1951, the materials advisory board projected the need for 30,000 tons of titanium products, but actual shipments were just 75 tons, barely enough for research applications. Producers had assumed that the same equipment for melting, rolling, and shaping stainless steel could be used for titanium, but this turned out to be very difficult: titanium didn’t behave like steel, or like any other metal. The first attempts to use titanium on commercial aircraft resulted in a sheet of metal so brittle it could be torn in half like a sheet of paper. Mills found that they often “produced more scrap than useful metal" (Simcoe 2018).
>
> To support the budding industry, the US government stepped in. It funded the construction of several titanium sponge plants, and agreed to purchase any surplus titanium sponge production for the national stockpile. It offered rapid amortization of titanium production equipment for tax purposes, and demonstrated production techniques at the Bureau of Mines’ pilot plant. The Army funded projects to develop better alloys, including one of 6% aluminum and 4% vanadium (Ti-6Al-4V) that remains the most popular alloy of titanium today, and is credited with saving the titanium industry. When it was found that rolling titanium into sheets consistently was difficult, in 1956 the Department of Defense initiated a program to develop sheet rolling of titanium, “one of the most comprehensive technical programs ever undertaken in metallurgy” (Simcoe 2018). Production problems were overcome, and titanium was increasingly used for aerospace applications. By 1958, Pratt and Whitney had produced 5000 jet engines with titanium components, and the US industry was producing thousands of tons of titanium products a year.

Another example of when the US government played BoFR to great effect is with transistor in the 1960s. The snippet below is taken from Neil Hacker’s [essay](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/buyers-of-first-resort#:~:text=Two%20examples%20from%20NASA%20illustrate%20how%20these%20work) on BoFRs.

> NASA utilized core rope computing in early Apollo missions but transitioned to transistors emerging from Bell Labs. Although initially larger and less reliable, NASA's bulk purchases of transistors spurred development, with the US government buying every integrated circuit in the world in 1962. By 1965, the market grew twentyfold and government purchases fell to 72% of market share. Transistors would’ve certainly gained adoption eventually as the superior technology, but the process could have taken much longer without NASA’s role as the Buyer of First Resort encouraged more private investment into R&D. The key to this success is that NASA’s purchases created quasi-market conditions for the transistors such that private firms had a quick feedback environment to iterate their products.

Sidenote: The Department of Energy is also an effective Buyer of First Resort. For example, Argonne and other national labs are the largest customers of Cerebras, SambaNova, and other early-stage AI chips companies.

## Potential pitfalls

The two examples below from the military show the risks of playing BoFR, including insurmountable technical risk, cost overruns, subcontractor culture, and changing requirements and political priorities.

- Navy and Marines acted as BoFRs for the [A-12 Avenger II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_A-12_Avenger_II), giving Boeing and General Dynamics $2B between 1988-1990. In 1991, the military canceled the program because they deemed the companies could not complete it, and ordered repayment. The case went to court, with the two contractors eventually settling on repaying $200M each to the Navy in 2014.
- Other examples include US Army's principal modernization program from 2003-2009 ([Future Combat Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Combat_Systems)) and the development of the [Comanche Helicopter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing%E2%80%93Sikorsky_RAH-66_Comanche), which cost a combined $39 billion before being shut down. Reliance on subcontractors and their subsequent price-gouging, lack of public scrutiny/transparency, and are some factors that contribute to these failures.
