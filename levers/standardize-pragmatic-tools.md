## Contributors

[Shihao Cao](https://www.shihaocao.com/) most recently worked on Starlink's Direct to Cell project which interfaces with many cellular standards. He previously was preivously in startups, researched flight software throughout college. He is excited about how policy can accelerate technological innovation.

[Jerry Sun](https://jsun14.github.io/) is the Head of Engineering at a precision agriculture startup. He is interested in thinking about how to best evolve policy to keep up with rapid technological advances. 

## Key things to know

Standardization is the process of deploying and developing technical standards based on the consensus of different parties (i.e. firms, users, interest groups, regulatory bodies, and governments)

Standardization also:
- Bridges adoption gaps
- Eliminates redundant research and development
- Reduces friction for users (i.e. consumers, contractors, corporations)

There are varied ways of standardizing:
- Government legislation
- Establishing regulatory bodies
- Consortiums

## Case study

The [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program (NEVI)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/02/28/2023-03500/national-electric-vehicle-infrastructure-standards-and-requirements) published by the Federal Highway Administration and Department of Transportation in 2023, seeks to encourage EV charging infrastructure development and standardization. It navigates which elements should or should not be legislated for the most public good.

### Key Points They Considered

- The NEVI program thought about current and future users. They balanced needs between current shorter range or hybrid EVs in addition to longer range vehicles that may not need densely placed stations along a route:
  > “50-mile distance was determined in order to ensure that older model EVs are not excluded”
- When specifically done by governments or non-profit regulatory bodies, standardization can be a powerful tool for serving disadvantaged communities, which are otherwise left behind by the market
  > "Historically, innovations in clean energy and transportation have not been deployed evenly across communities. This has resulted in underserved, overburdened, and disadvantaged communities being left behind."
- Standardize measurements
  > "State laws in several States prohibit this, allowing pricing in $/kWh only for utilities. The pricing structure of $/minute was identified as another option…A single, uniform, nationwide communication of pricing to customers, regardless of where they are traveling in the United States, is in the national interest; therefore $/kWh was retained."

### Pitfalls

Here are some example pitfalls along with examples of the FHWA being mindful of them.

- Refrain from standardize specific implementations that are still developing.
  - Regulation/regulators should not standardize in fields that have not yet explored the design space fully.
  > "FHWA has not modified the language in this final rule to specifically accommodate MD/HD needs so as not to preempt the pace of technological innovation."
- Considering future advancements or changes in consumer behavior is critical to avoiding pitfalls that may render standardizations obsolete shortly
  - Regulators wanted to continue incentivizing the Combined Charging System (CCS) since it was widely supported. However, Tesla had openly released its charging standard known as NACS. The EV industry saw the opportunity to adopt a standard that would interoperate with Tesla Supercharging, and work was [still actively adopting the newer NACS](https://driveelectric.gov/charging-connector). In order to account for future interoperability, regulators provisioned for CCS and the upcoming NACS.
  > “Recognizing the need for flexibility to accommodate the evolving technological needs of charging in the future, FHWA modified the language of this final rule to allow DCFC charging ports to have other non-proprietary connectors (specifically identifying NACS and CHAdeMO)”

  - This is an example where standardization should have happened but no standardization happened.
