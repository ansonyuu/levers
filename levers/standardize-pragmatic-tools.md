## Key things to know

- Sometimes, the number of options for a product, standard, or protocol, may not create additional opportunities for innovation, but instead may cause additional downstream overhead either in the form of consumer indecision, or unnecessary duplicated engineering work. Standardization may be useful to unblock engineering and focus innovation and competition in the leading edge of technology/value creation.
- Standardization may occur via:
  - Wholesale Donation of a Technology - giving away IP with no strings attached
  - Government intervention - incentivising or mandating actors to unify
  - Open Sourcing / Standards Bodies - creating an entity to further the interests of the technology itself
