## Key things to know

- Investment tax credits reduce an organization or individual’s tax liability if they invest in investment funds, companies, or technologies that meet certain criteria
- They are typically structured as Venture Capital Tax Credits or Angel Investor Tax Credits. These tax benefits are given to venture capital firms or individual angel investors in exchange for investing in qualifying entities, such as companies belonging to a particular industry. In rare cases, states will offer tax credits for investors in investment firms (called “limited partners”) to incentivize the establishment of more formal investment funds.
- Thirty-three American states have implemented investment incentive tax credits at some point. Twenty-two have active programs, with the majority being corporate tax credits or angel investor credits for direct investments in qualified companies. Only Iowa, Kentucky, and North Dakota give tax credits to individual investors in funds (”limited partners”).

## When to use

Investment tax credits are used to incentivize private capital to funnel in a particular geography or industry. Like [R&D Tax Credit](/collection?lever=R%26D%2520Tax%2520Credit), they can be an effective way to increase available funding for companies without directly spending taxpayer dollars. This is especially impactful in geographic areas that are not traditional hubs of private investor activity, such as the Midwest.

The appropriate types of investment tax credit (VC, angel investor, or limited partner) to establish depend on the region’s commercialization needs. Since venture capital firms typically invest in companies with revenue, VC tax credits typically increase funding for more established companies. Since angel investors invest at the earliest stages of company formation when there may not be an established product or revenue, angel investor tax credits incentivize more capital to flow into the earliest stages of the commercialization process.

A state that significantly lacks private capital at all stages could pair an angel investor tax credit with a limited partner tax credit to incentivize more individual investors and the creation of institutional firms. Once there are a few established venture funds, a VC tax credit can be introduced to continue growing the industry.

## Case study

Iowa offers an [Innovation Fund Tax Credit](https://www.iowaeda.com/innovate/innovation-fund-tax-credit/) that gives individual investors in venture capital funds (i.e. ”limited partners”) up to 25% of their investment amount back in tax credits. Since the program’s inception in 2014, 1,130 awards totaling $20.5 million in tax credits have been given.

Iowa also used to offer an [Angel Investor Tax Credit](https://www.iowaeda.com/innovate/angel-investor-tax-credit/) to incentivize wealthy individuals to directly invest in seed-stage startups. Both these tax credits had the primary goal of attracting capital investment to Iowa, and the secondary goal to create sustainable employment.

A [study](https://tax.iowa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-12/2022InnovationFundTaxCreditStudy.pdf) of these credits’ effectiveness across states conducted by the Iowa Department of Revenue found that states with investment tax credits witnessed statistically significant gains in private investment activity, both in terms of increasing the number of investors and the number of investments made. However, there is inconclusive evidence that these credits had a counterfactual impact on increasing long-term employment (i.e. without these tax credits, long-term employment might have increased at the same rate).

## Potential pitfalls

A 2019 [paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26099/w26099.pdf) (page 4) by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that investment tax credits tend to have outsized benefits for established businesses which deter entrepreneurship and new startup formation. This isn’t necessarily negative depending on the goals of the program, as the paper highlights that incumbents are able to develop capabilities faster due to increased investment.
