## Key things to know

- A production tax credit (PTC) provides tax relief to companies that generate a specified amount of a **\***thing**\***. It is typically used to incentivize clean energy production.
- Facilities must meet certain eligibility criteria to qualify for a PTC, such as being deployed before a certain deadline and meeting certain technical standards.
- Examples
  - The [renewable electricity PTC](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R43453.pdf) provides a tax credit for every kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by eligible renewable energy facilities
  - The [US refined coal PTC](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-104637) is given to energy producers who can demonstrate that burning refined coal reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides by at least 20% and either sulfur dioxide or mercury by at least 40% through field, laboratory, or pilot-scale testing
  - Alberta, Canada offers an [Agri-Processing Tax Credit](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/spring-has-sprung-in-alberta-with-new-1758645/) that combines a PTC and a [Investment Tax Credit](Investment%20Tax%20Credit%207c0c5c9fcbff4a7d8981e1b94e1feb2b.md). Corporations that invest $10M+ to build agri-processing facilities that become operational and profitable are eligible for a 12% tax credit against eligible capital expenditures.

## When to use

This lever is effective when there is a clear way to measure eligible production of the resource—both technically and whether the state has the capacity to (see interagency coordination challenge in potential pitfalls).

## Success case study

Iowa’s Wind Energy PTC and Renewable Energy PTC are some of the most successful clean energy tax credit programs in the United States. The programs provide credits worth $0.01 and $0.015 per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated at eligible facilities, respectively. The credits are available for a ten-year period starting from the facility’s in-service date.

Although 45 other states also offer tax incentives for production from renewable sources or improved energy efficiency, Iowa’s results outperformed most others. Between 2000 and 2018, wind energy capacity in Iowa grew by 43x, outpacing national growth and accounting for almost 8% of the US’s total wind energy capacity. Wind accounts for over one-third of the electricity generated in Iowa, the second-highest of any state.

Some features of Iowa’s programs that differentiate it from other states’ production tax incentives include:

- The rate for Iowa’s Renewable Energy PTC, $0.015 per kilowatt hour, is the highest state tax credit rate for energy produced from wind and other non-solar sources.
- Iowa is the only state whose production tax credits are fully transferable, meaning energy producers can buy or sell credits on the free market. This gives an additional financial incentive to energy producers to meet the credit requirements, as it allows them to directly profit from their credits.
- Only five other states offer PTCs for renewable energy that are allocated based on the amount of energy generated, such as per kilowatt hour. Aligning incentives with measurable output is key.

## Potential pitfalls

The refined coal production tax credit illustrates two potential pitfalls.

This credit is given to energy producers who burn refined coal instead of conventional coal — and can prove it emits fewer pollutants. Since the IRS last updated this program in 2010, refined coal producers have claimed over $9 billion in credits. The credits these producers claimed increased annually from about $9 million in 2010 to about $1.6 billion in 2019.

A 2021 US Government Accountability Office (GAO) [report](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-104637) found two issues:

- **Measuring production to determine eligibility can be a challenge.** The report found that the Department of Energy disagreed with producers’ methodology for proving cleaner emissions. Producers typically use pilot-scale plants to more easily attribute observed emissions reductions to burning refined coal. However, the DOE is uncertain that coal properties, treatment processes, and boiler conditions scale 1:1 from pilot-scale to normal-size plants.
- ************\*\*************\*\*************\*\*************\*\*************\*\*************\*\*************\*\*************Effective evaluation requires interagency coordination.************\*\*************\*\*************\*\*************\*\*************\*\*************\*\*************\*\************* To understand whether production tax credits are incentivizing correct behavior, multiple kinds of due diligence are required: fiscal, economic, and technical. Coordinating the disparate government agencies to work together can be challenging. The GAO report found that as of 2021, the IRS, Treasury, DOE, and EPA haven't reviewed potential overlap or whether the tax credit has achieved its purpose.

Similar challenges were illustrated by the 45Q carbon sequestration tax credit - a Treasury Inspector General [report](https://www.menendez.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/TIGTA) found that almost $1B in tax credits were improperly disbursed without proper EPA monitoring, reporting, and verification plans from 2010 to 2019.

Another potential pitfall is that tax credit programs take years to bear results, so they should be designed with a long time horizon to mitigate uncertainties from changes in political parties. The solar PTCs included in the Inflation Reduction Act had a [long life span](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/new-production-tax-credit-will-spur-solar-generation-development-costs-may-rise-30-08-2022#:~:text=The%20long%2Dlife%20span%20of%20these%20credits%20mitigates%20uncertainties%20from%20political%20party%20changes%20and%20improves%20cash%20flow%20visibility) for this reason.
