## Key things to know

- Tax credits can be given to buyers of technologies that the government wants to accelerate adoption for, such as electric vehicles.
- Evaluating counterfactual impact is key to determining whether to implement such demand-side policies. In other words, how many buyers would not have purchased the technology if the tax credit did not exist?

## How to use

To ensure effectiveness, consumer tax credits should be reserved for technologies with low technical risk that are ready to be commercialized. In addition, a high qualifying bar should be set to incentivize the adoption of first-rate technologies while ensuring that the requirements are realistic. However, to encourage adoption and maximize efficacy, the tax credit should be easy to comprehend; otherwise, it can create [unnecessary psychological burdens](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/business/electric-vehicle-tax-credits-consumers.html) for consumers to take the leap.

It is important to note that tax credits for consumers also tend to benefit those who have the discretionary capital to finance a purchase up-front and receive a tax credit a year later, e.g. [EV tax credits disproportionately go to wealthy citizens](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w21437/w21437.pdf). Despite that, consumer-oriented tax credits are an expedient tool to build political buy-in for new technologies compared to other types of [market-shaping levers](Consumption%20Tax%20Credit%20c82c9f15cf754987ae63325f40be3566.md).

## Case study

In 1978, Congress introduced a federal tax credit for residential energy-efficient equipment that ran until 1983. While an average of four million tax returns claimed the credit each year, totaling $2.3 billion, the qualifying amount was too low, resulting in many "free riders" — people who would have purchased the equipment regardless of the tax credit. Moreover, much of the equipment that qualified for the credit was not as energy-efficient as the best options available.

In response, new tax incentives included in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 sought to increase the market share of the most energy-efficient equipment, which were typically expensive and had <5% penetration. These tax credits were largely successful in accelerating the adoption of efficient washers, dishwashers, refrigerators, and hybrid cars according to a [report](https://www.aceee.org/files/pdf/white-paper/Tax%20incentive%20white%20paper.pdf) by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.

However, the report also identified several hurdles that prevented certain tax credits from being more effective, including the lack of simple paths for building shells and HVAC measures, the requirement for large savings to be achieved in a single system (lighting, HVAC, or building shell) to qualify for a credit, and the absence of regulations to make documentation of savings easy and reproducible. Additionally, tax incentives were created for two products that were not ready for adoption—residential fuel cell cogeneration and heavy-duty hybrids. While the former tax credit helped spur R&D, new products failed to gain consumer adoption, and the heavy-duty hybrid credit expired too soon to meaningfully increase market share.
