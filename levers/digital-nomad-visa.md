## Key things to know

- Many [small countries](https://expertvagabond.com/digital-nomad-work-visas/), especially tourist destinations, have begun offering temporary visas for remote workers to relocate, typically for up to 1-2 years
  - Common benefits of such visas include being exempt from income taxes, ability to open local bank accounts, fast track to a permanent visa, and localization support
- Some programs aim to incentivize long-term tourism like Bali’s [Digital Nomad Visa](https://www.notion.so/Digital-Nomad-Visa-7815e750ec9140148a7be38eef078b07?pvs=21) or Barbados’s [Welcome Stamp](https://www.visitbarbados.org/barbados-welcome-stamp). They tend to have lower minimum income requirements to attract more people. Other programs have more ambitious goals like advancing local entrepreneurship, or Costa Rica’s [Rentista](Rentista) visa—which allows visa holders to establish a business or work as a freelancer but prohibits being an employee. Most countries that wish to focus on bringing in new startups will create an explicit visa class for doing (see [Entrepreneur Visas](https://www.notion.so/Entrepreneur-Visas-ba1dca368f1644e79963b53682d27d25?pvs=21)).
- Variations of this idea have been tried at the intra-country level too. Dozens of [US cities](https://www.makemymove.com/get-paid) are giving remote workers cash to move. [Tulsa](https://tulsaremote.com/) provides free co-working spaces and helps new arrivals find a place to live, even providing new residents with a $10K stipend to rent or buy a home.
- Digital Nomad initiatives are useful for attracting labor with flexible work arrangements like software engineers. They can attract entire branches of companies and catalyze other longer-term talent-building initiatives. For example, if a country is able to bring in a few dozen employees from a large company, that company may consider opening local physical office space and creating a local presence. This could seed the country with a new crop of talent capable of kickstarting regional innovation. For example, many startup founders in Southeast Asia [originate from](https://www.techinasia.com/deep-dive-growing-influence-gojek-mafia) the superapp Gojek.

## Case study

In its first year, Barbados’s Welcome Stamp program received over 2800 applicants. Each paid a $2000 application fee, which monetarily benefited the country beyond those who actually made the move. The program checked many of the best practices for visas:

- Simple website that details the benefits of the visa, the qualifications necessary, and a simple online visa application process
- Easy renewal option for visa holders
- Reasonable income threshold
- Provides relocation resources to make the move seamless. These include places to rent homes, recommendations for restaurants, coworking spaces, and even suggestions for local schools for families that bring their kids
- No personal income tax incentivizes visa holders to start a local business, which is where the real economic development dollars are

## Potential pitfalls

Estonia’s [Digital Nomad Visa](https://www.e-resident.gov.ee/nomadvisa/) allows remote workers to move and work in Estonia for up to 1 year. While it was one of the first to launch globally, the program has been slow to take off and has a variety of lessons for countries designing new visas:

- Set income requirements with care. While an income threshold above what locals earn on average makes sense, putting the threshold too high can prevent those with irregular incomes (i.e. entrepreneurs) from not meeting the requirement.
- A one-year visa is useful to some, but a two-year visa with the possibility of an extension is superior because it gives visa holders the flexibility to spend significant amounts of time in the country if they wish.
- The application process needs to be easy and accessible for nomads who are tied to a computer, not a physical address. Requiring a visa applicant to go to the capital of their country of origin to visit your embassy is likely to dissuade potential applicants.
- Community is crucial. One of the most oft-cited issues for digital nomads is loneliness stemming from a lack of community. Visa programs that help nomads acclimate to the local culture are much more likely to be successful than those that have a hands-off approach.
- Think about the “stack” of products that your country can offer. For example, Estonia’s [e-Residency](https://www.e-resident.gov.ee/nomadvisa/) program allowed those interested in building a company in Europe to incorporate an Estonian company and run it remotely, which served as a stepping stone on a potential nomad’s journey.
