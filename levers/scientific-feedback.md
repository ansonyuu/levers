## Key things to know

_Definition and Significance_

- Scientists rarely receive certain forms of high-quality criticism on their work.
- Most feedback comes internally from one’s own research group, which is well-equipped to dispute experimental details or question individual experiments but is much less prone to challenge large-scale scientific assumptions, owing to selection bias. (Researchers usually join a group because they agree with one or more key axiomatic assumptions—for instance, a graduate student who joins a lab focusing on using water as a greener solvent for chemical synthesis is unlikely to hear pushback against this point.)
- Public feedback is possible, but other students or professors are unlikely to be very critical of a student seminar, with most “feedback” amounting to some form of “Nice talk.”
- The most reliable form of high-quality external feedback comes from peer review, which only occurs at the end of the scientific process—by the time a manuscript is submitted, it’s often very difficult to incorporate frequently excellent reviewer feedback.
- New ways of giving honest, high-quality feedback on ongoing projects would dramatically improve the quality of science.

[Seeds of Science](https://www.theseedsofscience.org/) is an organization built around the idea of working papers, which receive community attention from an early stage to help prune and strengthen them. There aren’t really obvious bottom-up incentives for adoption by individual scientists, though, that I’m aware of, and its use still seems rare (although it’s a young project).

This perhaps points to a larger challenge, which is that academics are deeply incentivized to publish as much as possible, and ongoing peer review would likely lead to fewer, better papers, which might not benefit researchers in the short term.
