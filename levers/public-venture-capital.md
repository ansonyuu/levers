## Key things to know

- Public venture capital funds are investment firms that are funded and/or operated with some association with a national government
- They may be used for:
  - Funding private technologies relevant to national interests to ensure that technology within government is at least competitive with private industry. Examples include [In-Q-Tel](https://www.iqt.org/) or China’s [guidance funds](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/understanding-chinese-government-guidance-funds/).
  - Address market failures by providing “patient capital,” such as China’s guidance funds or the DoD’s new [Office of Strategic Capital](https://www.cto.mil/osc/#:~:text=aims%20to%20offer%20%E2%80%9C-,patient%20capital,-%E2%80%9D%20to%20investors%20and)
  - Catalyze regional innovation where private capital is scarce, such as the [Arkansas Venture Capital Development Fund](https://adfa.arkansas.gov/program/arkansas-risk-capital-matching-fund), which provides 1:1 matching for private investments in Arkansas startups up to $1 million

## Case study

In-Q-Tel (IQT) is a non-profit venture capital firm that invests in critical technology startups with both commercial and national security (”dual-use”) potential. Although it is technically an independent non-profit, it has extremely close ties to the US intelligence community (IC) and is colloquially known as the “CIA’s venture arm.”

IQT was chartered as a [$28M fund](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2584117/study--cia-s-in-q-tel--worth-the-risk-.html#:~:text=February%201999%20with-,%2428%20million,-in%20venture%20capital) in 1999 by the CIA to [help](https://web.archive.org/web/20230419114244/https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2012/07/16/156839153/in-q-tel-the-cias-tax-funded-player-in-silicon-valley#:~:text=Its%20purpose%20was%20to%20help%20the%20CIA%20catch%20up%20with%20technology) the agency catch up in advanced technology. It quickly became a prolific player in funding deeptech dual-use startups. As of 2023, the firm has over 600 portfolio companies, [invests](https://www.iqt.org/how-we-work/#:~:text=in%20our%20portfolio.-,Every%20%241%20invested%20by%20In%2DQ%2DTel%20leverages%20%2444%20in%20private%20sector%20investment.,-Bringing%20Near%2DReady) in nearly one company per week, and has offices across the US, Europe, and Asia. They typically write $500,000 to $3 million checks and take board observer seats.

Its last fund performed in the top quartile of venture funds, with approximately three-quarters of its investments reaching Series B. Prominent portfolio companies include Palantir, FireEye, and Keyhole (acquired by Google and became the basis for Google Earth).

The firm’s close relationship with agencies like the CIA, NSA, and DoD enables a few competitive advantages over other private-sector VCs:

- The DoD and IC communicate their advanced tech needs to IQT, giving the firm unique insight into what companies are likely to succeed in receiving government contracts
- They can fast-track portfolio companies through the defense [procurement slog](https://www.niskanencenter.org/defense-contracting-is-broken-heres-how-to-fix-it/) due to their close relationships with the purchasing agencies. IQT’s core mission is to ensure the IC continually has access to cutting-edge technologies.

One key aspect of IQT’s success is its legal structure as an independent non-profit. This has allowed IQT to operate semi-autonomously from government oversight, shielding it from political gamesmanship that can [plague](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1991-12-01/technology-pork-barrel#:~:text=American%20political%20institutions%20introduce%20predictable%2C%20systematic%20biases%20into%20R%26D%20programs%20so%20that%2C%20on%20balance%2C%20government%20projects%20will%20be%20susceptible%20to%20performance%20underruns%20and%20cost%20overruns) traditional government R&D programs. The independence has also enabled IQT to attract top-tier investors and technologists with private-sector salaries (its CEO [made](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/522149962) $4 million in 2021).

## Potential pitfalls

As part of China’s efforts to surpass the US in advanced technology, the Chinese government has invested heavily in government guidance funds [政府引导基金]. These public-private investment funds aim to both produce financial returns and further the government’s industrial policy goals, such as reducing dependency on foreign supply chains.

The earliest GGFs appeared in the 2000s, but growth surged when Beijing sought to replace direct government subsidies in the mid-2010s for being inefficient/corrupt and undermining competition. The total assets under management by GGFs 68’d from 2010 to 2020, totaling $900 billion AUM by 2020.

In theory, GGFs have a few distinct advantages versus other government funding mechanisms:

- They provide “patient capital” to help advanced technology companies (which are typically capital-intensive) cross the [valley of death](https://www.pwc.no/en/bridging-the-technological-valley-of-death.html)
- They complement and amplify other industrial policy measures
- They align markets with national interest

While there are successful GGFs and a few high-profile investment winners (such as Nio and iFlyTek), a [2021 report](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/understanding-chinese-government-guidance-funds/) by the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) questioned the effectiveness of GGFs in aggregate. As the authors detail:

> In practice, most guidance funds fail to live up to their ambitions, weakened by unrealistic goals, bureaucratic constraints, incompetent management, risk aversion, and a lack of market discipline. Our research shows that:
>
> - Guidance funds often raise much less money than planned.
> - Much of the money guidance funds raise is never actually invested in projects.
> - There are too many guidance funds, leading to redundancy and inefficiency.
> - Many guidance funds are poorly managed.
> - Guidance fund capital has been wasted on nonstrategic and illicit activities.
> - Guidance funds do not invest in early-stage companies as intended.
> - Guidance funds often fail to attract truly private capital, and in some cases may even crowd private capital out of the market.
