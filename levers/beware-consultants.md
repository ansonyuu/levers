## Key things to know

- Bureaucracies often pay consultants to advise them. While consulting firms often have decades of industry knowledge and can be valuable, oftentimes they inflate their own value.
- A frustrated scientist at an unnamed science agency told us that many leaders in their office are ex-McKinsey consultants, and therefore love hiring McKinsey to advise them. In one case, the agency spent $1 million to have McKinsey “tell them something they already knew how to do and turn them into pretty powerpoints.”
- This behavior is what technology writer Alex Danco refers to as “[McKinsey ass-covering](https://alexdanco.com/2019/09/07/positional-scarcity/)":
  - “When a company faces the dilemma of an abundance of choice, its executives (who don’t want to get blamed should their choice turn out poorly) often seek out a consultant, who acts as a curator – someone who can help them sort through, “out of all these options, which one should I pick?” The curators that they hire – consultants like McKinsey or BCG – use the prestige of their reputations to sell their clients a form of reassurance, or legitimacy, that “you know you’ve made the right choice, because you can say that we advised you.” McKinsey sells a little bit of their prestige to the client, and in doing so solves their curation problem by making any option they choose feel like the best one.”
- A common argument for hiring consultants is that an organization lacks in-house expertise or the capacity to do the work themselves. The challenge with applying this reasoning to initiatives that create or fund technology is that any third-party contractor without “skin in the game,” including consultants, is not incentivized to think about what is best for the organization long-term.
- These misaligned incentives are especially deadly for ambitious science and technology missions, which require years of sacrifice, focus, and freedom to explore and pivot if necessary.

## Case study [don’t include on website bc it disparages my workplace]

The following case study on the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in Congress is not explicitly relevant to ‘bewaring consultants’—rather, it highlights the importance of having in-house expertise. Congress’s ability to create effective technology policy significantly weakened when it canceled the office in 1995, and much of the institution’s technical expertise today comes from temporary fellowships like [TechCongress](https://techcongress.io/), [AAAS](https://www.aaas.org/programs/science-technology-policy-fellowships), and [Horizon](https://www.horizonpublicservice.org/) (although many of these fellows transition to full-time roles after their 1-year fellowship).

The Office of Technology Assessment was an in-house think tank within Congress from 1974 to 1995 that advised policymakers on a broad range of science and technology issues. Unlike the Congressional Research Service, which synthesizes existing research into issue briefs and summaries, OTA focused on multi-disciplinary, expert-reviewed analysis that informed the policymaking process at a deeper level (similar to what RAND does for the DoD).

At its peak, OTA had a budget of $37 million in 2019 dollars— and ~140 full-time employees.

In 1994, Republicans regained control of the House for the first time in 40 years under the banner of the “Contract with America”—their 1994 campaign platform that focused on government accountability and cutting wasteful spending. Under this context, OTA was defunded in 1995 as part of a largely symbolic cost-savings effort.

The elimination of OTA was not an isolated incident. The authors write:

> The same appropriations bill that defunded it brought significant cuts to Congress in several other areas, including major reductions in the number of personal office, committee, and support agency staff. Changes in House Rules also increased leadership influence over committee assignments. These changes had the (likely intended) effect of strengthening the hand of congressional leadership over committees and building a stronger reliance of members of Congress on outside interests, especially think tanks and trade associations.

As part of the overall cuts to staff, Congress lost significant capacity in key committees of jurisdiction for S&T, including the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. For instance, House Science went from 92 to 51 staff between 1994 and 2016 (−45%).

Other S&T Congressional support agencies were also significantly reduced.

Since the defunding, a few efforts Slowly building. GAO’s [Science, Technology Assessment, and Analytics (STAA)](https://www.gao.gov/about/careers/our-teams/STAA). The announcement for STAA’s launch came in January 2019,63 and its initial strategic plan was released in April 2019.64 According to these documents, STAA set out to “combine and enhance our technology assessment functions and our science and technology evaluation into a single, more prominent office to better meet Congress’s growing need for information on these important issues.

This expert role, which is provided by Congress’s other legislative agencies—CRS, GAO, CBO—is not intended to make decisions for the legislative branch, but to arm staff and members with the information they need to develop and advance their policy agendas.
