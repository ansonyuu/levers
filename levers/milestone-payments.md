## Key things to know

- Milestone payments are a procurement mechanism whereby payments are paid to the supplier in increments upon completion of specific performance objectives or milestones that are agreed to upfront
- Two primary objectives of the mechanism are to **\*\***1)**\*\*** reward builders for intermediate progress toward a technically difficult goal and **\*\***2)**\*\*** reduce payment risk and the potential for budget overruns for the funder
  - One example where milestone payments might have helped prevent budget overruns was the creation of [Healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov/), which ended up costing [$1.7 billion](https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-03-14-00231.asp). According to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) [report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-14-694.pdf), the Medicare agency in charge of building the site used cost-reimbursement contracts, paying contractors' allowable costs regardless of the final amount or system completion. A milestone-based contract would have tied the payment to outcomes, thus aligning incentives.
- Failure to achieve a milestone should not automatically warrant a rejection of funding or payment. Instead, it should prompt an investigation into “_why?_” to inform next steps. The funder might decide to redefine the milestone, terminate the project, move on to the next objective, or whatever is deemed most appropriate

## When to use

Milestone payments are effective when the technology being purchased is risky but has clear intermediate objectives that, if met, de-risk the technology’s development. It should not be used for technologies that are too immature or are almost commercializeable. It is not realistic to assign pre-defined milestones to overly novel technologies in the former case, and a standard pay-upon-delivery contract model can be used for the latter. Technologies with a [Technology-Readiness-Level](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/engineering/technology/technology_readiness_level) (TLR) between 3-6 would fit within these bounds.

## Success case study

NASA’s [](https://www.thecgo.org/benchmark/a-2006-nasa-program-shows-how-government-can-move-at-the-speed-of-startups/)milestone-based payment model with SpaceX detailed a series of payments to be delivered upon achieving milestones for the Falcon 9 rocket delivery of cargo and astronauts. This flexible model enabled SpaceX to compete with incumbents in resupplying the International Space Station (ISS). The significance of this partnership model is highlighted by a [memo](https://uploads.dayoneproject.org/2021/09/10150642/Industrial-Policy-Memo.pdf) written by the Day One project:

> For an investment of roughly $400 million, NASA gained access to a capability that would have cost them [$1.7-4B](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20170008895) and reduced US dependence on Russian rockets to access the ISS. It also **p**ropelled the US to a leadership position in commercial launch services, from 0% of the global commercial-launch market in 2010 to 65% by 2018

Eli Dorado, senior fellow at Utah State’s Center for Growth and Opportunity, [identified](https://www.notion.so/Milestone-Payments-1706719eb767471f9d8007c10eec3638?pvs=21) three unique features of this payment model that enabled its success:

> First, each of the companies selected was expected to pay part of its own development costs. This ensured that the companies were building something useful they could go on to commercialize — they would not have agreed to share costs to build something they knew was inefficient.
>
> Second, the use of fixed-price, milestone-based payments limited the amount of oversight necessary to ensure success. It allowed NASA to turn over development entirely to the companies, knowing that it was only on the hook for payments when the programs successfully met pre-defined milestone criteria.
>
> Third, NASA didn’t dictate the vehicle’s requirements. They evaluated the proposals based on the goal of providing reliable cargo service to the ISS, but they didn’t specify the technical means that participants could use to achieve that goal.

A crucial detail to highlight is that SpaceX received all the underlying rights to the system it developed. Critics might characterize this as “corporate welfare,” but under the right conditions, this approach can lower government costs compared to directly operating a contractor-built system. If an unexpected issue arose during Falcon 9’s development, SpaceX still had an incentive to fix it because they were the ultimate beneficiary of the R&D. For a government-owned project (e.g. the Obamacare website), if a given step turned out to be hairier than expected, the contractor might try to shirk and slide by, doing a mediocre job. The Obamacare site cost >[$880M](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/07/obamacare-website-has-cost-840-million/440478/) because they had to switch contractors multiple times due to poor performance.

In other words, milestone payments are a useful contracting tool when the agency is trying to subsidize **the development of a product it wants to use but not own**.

## Potential pitfalls

Potential pitfalls of implementing milestone payments include overemphasizing short-term results, failing to adapt to changing circumstances, and giving up support for high-risk projects upon failures.
