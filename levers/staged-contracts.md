## Key things to know

Cross-posting from the Innovative Contracting Case Studies report [(pg. 7](https://strategicinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/innovative_contracting_case_studies_2014_-_august.pdf)):

- A staged contract is an innovative contracting model that follows a three-phase evaluation process consisting of a short concept paper, invite-only full proposal, and subsequent 1-2 year pilot evaluation.
- They may be used by the government for the rapid and inexpensive assessment of many existing or prototype private-sector technologies. They forgo the extensive requirements of traditional acquisition processes in favor of short concept papers, and let agencies sample the diverse technology landscape for potential solutions.
- Concept papers allow Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) respondents to communicate the essence of their proposal without expending undue time and effort, thereby reducing administrative burden for both offerors and agencies. Reducing the barrier to sell into the government from a 300+ page request-for-proposal (RFP) to an 8-page concept paper allows more startups to participate as well.
- In general, staged contracts follow these steps:
  - Announce: agencies release a broad solicitation for contractors to submit short concept papers
    communicating the essence of their proposed technologies.
  - Study: agencies invite promising offerors to submit detailed full proposals with both technical
    and cost/price components.
  - Evaluate: agencies evaluate selected full proposals in 1-2 year pilots, during which there is
    ample opportunity for offerors to communicate with end users and refine their technology.
  - Deploy: agencies decide to deploy, terminate, or further evaluate pilots.

## Case study

Taken from the Innovative Contracting Case Studies report on [page 33](https://strategicinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/innovative_contracting_case_studies_2014_-_august.pdf):

> The Department of Veterans Affairs Innovation Initiative (VAi2) Industry Innovation Competition illustrates the promise of staged contracts. The VAi2 Competition did not award contracts for the full 12-24 month implementation until two previous stages of paper evaluations had been completed: initial concept papers followed by invitation-only full proposals.
>
> The VAi2 Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) was issued under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 35.016 and 6.102(d)(2)(i), which provide for the competitive selection of proposals submitted in response to a BAA. The VAi2 competition has awarded no fewer than 135 solutions worth $102.5 million, fielded solutions in eight topic areas, received over 20,000 ideas from 600 industry offerors, and collaborated with over 100 subject matter experts.
>
> The VAi2 Competition staged contracts followed a three-phase process consisting of an eight-page concept paper, 50-page invite-only full proposal, and a 1-2 year pilot evaluation. It attracted a 50-50 mix of established and first-time government contractors, unique to government procurement applications that predominantly feature large companies.
