## Key things to know

- Regional innovation hubs are clusters of businesses, universities, governments, philanthropies, and other institutions that foster science and technology development in a specific region
  - “Region” has a broad definition here — it could be a city or a network of cities within close proximity
  - Lowell, Massachusetts is the proto-typical American cluster with its historical textile industry
  - Detroit, Michigan is recognized around the world as the motor city for its tightly clustered automobile industry
  - The Research Triangle in North Carolina is a hub for biotechnology and high technology
- Hubs can grow organically, or be intentionally designed as part of a national economic and technological development strategy and then implemented at the local level
- Successful hubs establish a unique advantage relative to other hubs (e.g. Silicon Valley in software) by becoming a hotspot for talent and capital in particular industries or technologies
- The successful growth of hubs can differ greatly depending on the degree of government involvement, geographic scope (e.g. city-focused on region-focused), global economy, funding, etc.

## When to use

For communities, trying to cultivate a new hub or cluster is often make or break when they need to diversify their economy to provide strong local employment and growth. Cultivating new hubs is especially important when places rely solely on lagging industries and services to support their economy. For example, the state of New Mexico’s economy is largely supported by fossil fuels, tourism, and services. As the fossil fuel industry has lagged they have leaned into their existing advantages in aerospace (with prominent government labs nearby) to build up a commercial space industry ecosystem.

At the national level, having geographically diverse hubs spreads the wealth created by successful firms across the country, and brings employment, tax, and spending benefits to places outside major metropolitan areas. Having highly specialized firm in promising industries and technologies cluster together helps grow agglomeration economies that make the entire ecosystem more globally competitive.

Regional innovation hubs have been a strong economic priority for the Biden administration. The following programs are very new so it’s hard to judge how successful each cluster will be, but there are high expectations for the growth opportunities they will bring.

- The United States’s Economic Development Administration (EDA), as part of the American Rescue Plan, funded the [$1B Build Back Better Regional Challenge](https://www.eda.gov/funding/programs/american-rescue-plan/build-back-better) which provided locales with funding to develop nascent industry hubs. These awards funded everything from biotechnology to advanced aerospace manufacturing to clean energy.
  - One project is successfully diversifying the economy of Osceola County (famous for farmland and Disneyland) by cultivating a [semiconductor manufacturing industry](https://fas.org/publication/packaging-semiconductors-at-the-doorstep-to-disney/).
- As part of the CHIPS and Science Act, the EDA and the National Science Foundation (NSF) were authorized to launch similar but meaningfully different hub programs.
  - The EDA was authorized to spend $10B (of which $500M has been appropriated) to develop [regional technology hubs](https://www.eda.gov/funding/programs/regional-technology-and-innovation-hubs) across the country.
  - The NSF launched a [Regional Innovation Engines program](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/regional-innovation-engines) which awards locales up to $160M over 10 years to seed and grow innovation ecosystems in a range of critical technologies.

## Case study

Regional innovation hubs are a key component of China’s industrial policy to accelerate its AI industry. China’s Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) has directed at least seventeen cities and counties to create ‘[AI pilot zones](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/guidelines-for-national-new-generation-artificial-intelligence-innovation-and-development-pilot-zone-construction-work/)’ to advance AI R&D and commercialization.

Each zone focuses on AI applications tailored to that region’s particular needs or advantages. For example, Deqing, a county that had a burgeoning agtech and autonomous vehicle ecosystem, was directed to [focus](https://web.archive.org/web/20230419032142/https://subsites.chinadaily.com.cn/huzhou/2019-11/08/c_423374.htm) on AI applications in agtech and transportation.

Provincial and city governments generally have high autonomy in deciding which policy levers to pull. The most common levers include (1) capital — mobilizing public and private funds to invest in local initiatives (2) institutions — e.g. establishing new research labs, supporting existing ones, public-private partnerships and (3) workforce development.

For example, after Hangzhou was directed to set up a pilot zone in 2019, they proposed setting up early and late-stage AI guidance funds and supporting businesses with M&A, IPOs, and bond issuance. They also continued to facilitate public-private AI partnerships, such as the [Zhejiang AI lab](https://en.zhejianglab.com/), which was a ¥5 billion joint investment by Alibaba, the Zhejiang provincial government, and Zhejiang University (the top college in Hangzhou). In 2022, they worked with the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (which some call the OpenAI of China) to launch one of the world’s largest mixture-of-expert (MoE) models with 14.5T parameters, [BaGuaLu](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3503221.3508417).

It is currently difficult to evaluate whether China’s AI pilot zones are successful. While there are a few notable examples of labs and companies being created in these zones, it is tough to say what would’ve happened in a counterfactual scenario where no formal zone was established. In addition, China’s opaque financial data, the unknown nature of public-private ‘fusion,’ and the fact that many of these zones are <3 years old makes it impossible to analyze its aggregate success. However, the high-level principles and mechanisms behind these zones are worthy of being studied and considered for similar initiatives by other countries.

## Potential pitfalls

Efforts to create a “Silicon X” across the world

Numerous countries and locales have sought to capitalize on the success and brand name recognition of Silicon Valley by trying to promote local tech development (particularly software) through a variety of different incentives and strategies. These Silicon X’s have a mixed track record.

For example, ‘Silicon Wadi’ is a term used to describe the cluster of globally successful technology companies around Tel Aviv, Isrel. This cluster features an extremely high number of both startups and established global technology companies that conduct R&D in Tel Aviv. The success of the startup ecosystem is due in part to a successful government program to grow a nascent venture capital landscape in the 1990s called the [Yozma Program](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11187-010-9298-z) (modeled after the United States’ Small Business Investment Company Program). Other factors include a robust higher education system and programs to incentivize the immigration of high-skilled workers.

When they fail, such hubs fail for a variety of reasons, but the most notable factor is a failure to lean into a comparative advantage. Places that seek to become the next emerging software cluster are competing against a slew of other locations seeking to attract the same entrepreneurs, risk capital, and corporate partners. In contrast, a given place may have a stronger chance trying to grow a hub around an industry in which they have a comparative advantage rather than trying to copy the pathway of high-growth software clusters.
