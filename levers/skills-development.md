## Definition

A buyer of first resort is an entity that is willing to be the first purchaser of new technologies. In many cases, the buyer of first resort is the military, as it has the resources and willingness to invest in high-risk, high-reward technologies that could potentially provide strategic advantages.

A BoFR frees companies with early-stage products to invest in continual improvements and scale. Without one, companies may feel pressured to commercialize prematurely.

As opposed to an [Advanced market commitment](https://www.notion.so/Advanced-market-commitment-1f6b3b62f0a9406a8a08ac409f48c7c9) which incentivizes inventing products that don’t currently exist, the goal of first resort buyers is to incentivize refining an MVP product that already exists

## Significance

Buyers of First Resort encourage risk-taking by sharing some of the risk that the product does not work out, rather than placing it entirely on the firms developing it.

Half of SBIR-backed projects fail to reach commercialization because [market demand is too small](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/11929/chapter/7#118)

## Success example

- [Transistors](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/buyers-of-first-resort#:~:text=Two%20examples%20from%20NASA%20illustrate%20how%20these%20work): NASA utilized rope core computing in early Apollo missions but transitioned to transistors emerging from Bell Labs. Although initially larger and less reliable, NASA's bulk purchases of transistors spurred development, with the US government buying every integrated circuit in the world in 1962. By 1965, the market grew twentyfold and government purchases fell to 72% of market share. Transistors would’ve certainly gained adoption eventually as the superior technology, but the process could have taken much longer without NASA’s role as the Buyer of First Resort encouraged more private investment into R&D.
- The key to this success is that NASA’s purchases created quasi-market conditions for the transistors such that private firms had a quick feedback environment to iterate their products.

## Failure example

Navy and Marines acted as BoFRs for the [A-12 Avenger II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_A-12_Avenger_II), giving Boeing and General Dynamics $2B between 1988-1990. In 1991, the military canceled the program because they deemed the companies could not complete it, and ordered repayment. The case went to court, with the two contractors eventually settling on repaying $200M each to the Navy in 2014.

Military failures due to cost overruns, technical challenges, and changing priorities (long-term projects need long-term will). Other examples include US Army's principal modernization program from 2003-2009 ([Future Combat Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Combat_Systems)) and the development of the [Comanche Helicopter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing%E2%80%93Sikorsky_RAH-66_Comanche), which cost a combined $39 billion before being shut down. Reliance on subcontractors and their subsequent price-gouging, lack of public scrutiny/transparency, and increasing Congressional defense budget are some factors that contribute to outsized failure. State capacity is key!
