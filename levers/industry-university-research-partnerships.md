## Key things to know

- Research partnerships between industrial organizations and universities [began growing](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/5579/chapter/2) in popularity in the 1980s, as private companies [increasingly focused](https://hbr.org/2018/01/why-companies-and-universities-should-forge-long-term-collaborations) on commercialization and ceding early-stage research (basic and applied) to academia.
  > From a 1997 National Academies report: “Collaborative partnerships have become strategic assets for companies that face increasingly rapid technological change, increasingly intense international competition, and diminishing in-house research resources. Such partnerships have become more attractive to universities, too, as overall growth in public funding for research has slowed substantially since the 1980s. **The federal government's efforts in the 1980s to stimulate technological innovation while reducing spending spawned an array of initiatives designed specifically to encourage industry-university collaboration in R&D.**”
- There are [four main types](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/5579/chapter/3) of IURPs:
  - **Single Company/Multi-University:** For example, materials company Celanese established partnerships with Rutgers, North Carolina State, and UNC Chapel Hill in the late 90s to determine if the company could conduct a significant portion of its discovery research externally, and whether this process would be beneficial to the partner universities.
  - **Multi-Company/Single University Model**: MIT’s famous Media Laboratory researches emerging information technologies and receives funding from a [wide range](https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/membership-levels/#members) of corporate partners including Hyundai, Google, and L’Oreal.
  - **Single Company/Single University**: Red Hat [created](https://hbr.org/2018/01/why-companies-and-universities-should-forge-long-term-collaborations#:~:text=Cloud%20Computing%20Initiative.-,BU,-and%20Red%20Hat) a $5M partnership with Boston University to advance research and education on open source and emerging technologies, including cloud computing, and machine learning. BU and Red Hat will jointly license co-developed technology while each party retains exclusive rights to its pre-existing IP. In addition, IP developed solely by either BU or Red Hat will be owned by whichever organization employs the inventor. The aim is not only to establish an enduring relationship with BU that spawns co-developed IP in Red Hat’s sweet spot — cloud computing technologies and systems — but also to create a pipeline of graduate students who will seriously consider jobs at the company.
  - **Multi-Company/Multi-University Model:** University of Rochester’s [Center for Emerging and Innovative Sciences](https://www.ceis.rochester.edu/collaboration/index.html) conducts basic research at the frontiers of imaging, remote sensing, and telecommunication. The center receives participation from a few New York universities including the University of Rochester and the Rochester Institute of Technology, and receives funding from many corporate sponsors and the State of New York.

## When to use

IURPs are effective when private companies have a clear interest in furthering early-stage research that can be translated into a commercial product. The topics of research should be novel enough that universities are uniquely positioned to pursue them due to lack of for-profit constraints, but not so mature that companies would invest in it themselves. Technologies with a [Technology-Readiness-Level](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/engineering/technology/technology_readiness_level) (TLR) between 2-5 would fit within these bounds.

## Case study

The National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) program connects industry partners and government agencies with university researchers to pursue three main objectives:

- Conduct high-impact research to meet shared and critical industrial needs
- Enhance U.S. global leadership in critical technologies
- Develop a diverse, highly skilled STEM workforce

Each IUCRC is an industry-funded, university-led research center that focuses on a specific research topic beneficial to industry and academia alike. In exchange for industry funding, corporate partners receive intellectual property (IP) rights and other financial benefits. The NSF covers overhead funding to the universities to offset costs normally incurred by industry for sponsoring university research, with 90% of funds going to research expenses. Since 1973, the NSF has stood up over 200 IUCRCs, and there are currently **over 80 IUCRCs that cumulatively involve 110+ universities, 700+ private entities, and 20+ federal members.**

A [2006 IEEE case study](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9058288) on IUCRCs enumerated the advantages of the model’s program mechanics. Some of them are:

- **Speed:** The IUCRC provides an instant funding vehicle for sponsored research. After the proposal is accepted, the research can start right away without the typical lengthy evaluation process.
- **Sustained support:** The IUCRC provides members with the opportunity to provide low-cost and sustained long-term research support. The lifespan of an IUCRC can be 15 years. Then, if the IUCRC is still active, it should exist on its own without NSF support.
- **Accountability:** An IUCRC has two annual reviews where new research is proposed and ongoing research is reviewed. Both provide opportunities for industry partners to actively and in real-time okay, modify, or even reject research proposals and projects.
- **Talent training:** IUCRCs enable corporate sponsors to train student researchers, who are the next generation of subject matter experts (SMEs). At the conclusion of the project, the SMEs are ready to step into research positions and produce right out of the gate, saving recruitment and training costs.
- **Sharing the upside:** All IUCRC industry members have opportunities to share in any IP produced by the IUCRC. The IP can be marketed and used in follow-on projects that expand on the fundamental research produced by the IUCRC teams.
