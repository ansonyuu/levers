## Key things to know

- Cooperative agreements (CAs) are a funding mechanism used by the US government in which there is “substantial staff involvement” from the awarding federal agency to the contractor.
- Staff involvement may include assisting in system design and implementation, consistently evaluating progress, training or receiving training from grantee staff, and more
- CAs are officially authorized in statute under the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (“Grant Act”) of 1978, which standardizes the definitions of legal funding instruments such as cooperative agreements and grants
- The purpose of including CAs in this database is to highlight the value of legally distinguishing between them and grants. By assigning obligations to the state to ensure the contractor is successful, CAs provide the legal mechanism to make large-scale, public-private research projects feasible.

## When to use

CAs are typically used for large-scale projects that require agency expertise to implement well. For example, the many Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) [cooperative agreements](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/partnerships/index.html) target public health initiatives that require integration with the agency’s pre-existing systems programs. Therefore, guidance from the CDC is needed for the contract winner to perform the task successfully.

## Success case study

In 2021, the National Science Foundation (NSF) distributed [24%](https://www.nsf.gov/about/budget/fy2023/pdf/01_fy2023.pdf) of its funding through CAs to support capital-intensive research investments like research centers. In 2015, NSF hired the National Academy of Public Administration (the Academy), an independent non-profit, to review NSF’s use of CAs in developing and maintaining $100 million+ research facilities.

The examination found that CAs were mostly successful in serving their purpose—in providing enough funding and supervision to the project without overburdening the awardee with logistical requirements. Indeed, the most critical success factor for NSF CAs identified by the report was the “project management discipline—and the rigor of review processes—in place along with the capacity and capability of a skilled workforce to carry out and oversee project management responsibilities.” In other words, the rare combination of technical and managerial experience was critical in ensuring NSF’s capacity to conduct effective, but not overly intrusive oversight.

The CA instrument also affords flexibility to tailor project-specific requirements and performance metrics. Unlike a contract modification, these can be readily adjusted as needed to ensure the appropriate rigor in oversight with relatively minimum administrative and time burdens

The government-wide environment today is one of tight budgets and intensified oversight, a condition that is not likely to change in the near future. The agency will need to make some hard funding decisions that address the demand for more rigorous accountability systems balanced against the mission to advance science. In the long run, one does not necessarily have to be at the expense of the other—but there are likely to be short-term impacts as changes are implemented and institutionalized across the science community.

## Potential pitfalls

Like any government funding mechanism, there are implicit and explicit strings attached to cooperative agreements that can derail program implementation, or disincentivize entities from applying in the first place.

As one case study into public health cooperative agreements [highlighted](https://www.naccho.org/uploads/downloadable-resources/Co-Ag-Case-Studies-Case-Study-1.pdf):

> The potential exists, however, with such a complex network of funding sources and layers of requirements, that competing interests of funding sources and overly prescriptive or restrictive requirements may impede achievement of the purpose or goals of the cooperative agreement. The resulting infrastructure or environment for recipients may lead to tradeoffs between achieving one objective over another, duplication of efforts, increased administrative burden, and other barriers to achieving goals. In some cases, the time and expense to perform award activities may exceed the value of the award. Due to this, potential applicants may choose not to apply for the funding opportunity.

The report goes on to dissect issues that three CDC cooperative agreements faced. They include:

- **Increasing layers of complexity:** “Interviewees acknowledged the necessity of requirements and how they may arise from each different funding source but that the intertwining of funding strings adds complexity; so much so that one interviewee noted the perception that there is: “more complexity” in public health than in their previous employment sector in the banking system.”
- **Work duplication:** “An additional challenge with the IMM-VFC program is duplicative data entry into different systems for client health records, immunization registry, surveillance systems, and other program-specific systems as required by the state. To make matters worse for the agency, at the time of interview, the respondent noted that they had become aware of an additional state-sponsored tracking system for entering electronic disease surveillance information that may be relevant for COVID-19, described as: “another system as yet to be rolled out…to be trained on…so, it literally is double-entry…”
- **\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\***Micromanagement:**\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\*** “Micromanagement of fund activities was held as a primary factor to impeding achievement of cooperative agreement goals or objectives. Further complication ensued when funding was bundled from multiple State administrative units which contained different managers with their own, and often competing, priorities.”
- **\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\***Onerous reporting requirements:**\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\*** “Interviewees reported obligations that were overly onerous or impeding to the objectives of subawards passed through the State. Elevated reporting burdens and human resource allocations were frequently cited as a key barrier to achievement — a common theme across case studies. A key example is in double entry of data, either being requested by separate administrative units at the State or required to be entered into separate State-stewarded information systems.”
