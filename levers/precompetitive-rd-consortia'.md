## Key things to know

> “In pre-competitive R&D consortia, firms that are normally competitors in the market **work together on a common technology platform**, sharing the resulting intellectual property from which they can develop differentiated downstream products to compete against each other. The collaboration pools resources and expertise, and provides a site at which **public policy can constructively subsidize investment without “picking winners and losers.” —** [American Compass](https://americancompass.org/policy-brief-pre-competitive-rd-consortia/)

- Individual companies are discouraged from pursuing resource-intensive, long-term moonshots due to short-term market incentives (e.g. stock price) and capital. Executives want to avoid risking their careers by investing in a potential failure when they have a reliable business model, even when idleness leads to long-term stagnation. Clay Christensen famously describes this predicament as the “[Innovator’s Dilemma](https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Change-Business/dp/0062060244).”
- In theory, companies can mitigate risk by distributing the social and financial downside across other companies through R&D partnerships. In practice, however, collective action problems arise such as intellectual property rights and capital commitments (”if I invest more I deserve more of the upside”).
- The government is uniquely positioned to resolve these collective action problems. Unlike an individual company, the government has enough social and financial capital to be the “first mover” in the network to _convene_ private entities. States can also use their legal authority to create special incentives for such consortia, such as exempting them from antitrust prohibitions, mandating that IP rights are shared with all participants, and matching public funds to committed private funds.

## When to use

Willy Shih, economics and business professor at Harvard Business School, [describes](https://americancompass.org/on-research-development/) the two circumstances that favor PCCs:

> (1) when the scale and complexity of R&D needed to remain competitive outpace individual firms’ in-house capabilities, and (2) when the target area for partnering is some distance from downstream product markets, focusing on enabling technologies rather than specific market segments or niches.

Although there are examples of purely commercial PCCs with no government support, policymakers often use them as part of their industrial policy toolbox. In another [essay](https://americancompass.org/policy-brief-pre-competitive-rd-consortia/#:~:text=Helping%20the%20Private%20Sector%20Help%20Itself), Dr. Shih describes the policy principles for establishing PCCs:

> Rather than attempt to identify the specific industries and platforms that would benefit, policymakers should establish an open-ended template and invite any industry that sees the value to participate. For instance, a PCC must be open to all firms within an industry and have a set formula to guide participation requirements, based on sales, capital expenditures, and other factors, as well as a clear governance structure.
>
> Funding commitments must extend for a significant duration, all participants must have full access to the resulting intellectual property, and both the IP and any production capacity it sparks must remain in the U.S. PCCs have an impressive track record in industries like semiconductors, aerospace, and biotechnology that depend on sophisticated technology platforms far upstream from final competitive products.

## Success case studies

**Case #1: SEMATECH**

In the 1980s, US market share of semiconductors (and other advanced technology products) plunged in the face of Japanese competition. In response, Congress passed the National Cooperative Research Act of 1984, which provided the legal framework for the formation of research consortia. Three years later, the federal government partnered with industry on a research consortium called SEMATECH to fund R&D projects that could uplift the industry.

![**[A Guide to the Semiconductor Industry - American Compass](https://americancompass.org/a-guide-to-the-semiconductor-industry/)**](Pre-Competitive%20R&D%20Consortia%20c07f6245c9c3483bb586ab934aad3a6c/Untitled.png)

**[A Guide to the Semiconductor Industry - American Compass](https://americancompass.org/a-guide-to-the-semiconductor-industry/)**

The initial 14 companies agreed to join the consortia because they all felt that no firm acting on its own could compete effectively. As Dr. Shih [explains](https://americancompass.org/on-research-development/#:~:text=of%20such%20a-,collaboration,-was%20SEMATECH%2C%20established):

> [They companies believed that] pooling resources and sharing technology had the potential to increase the effective scale of American industry and to recover market share. Initial goals included industry infrastructure—especially the capabilities of specialized equipment and materials suppliers—manufacturing processes, and factory management. The founders agreed to contribute in proportion to their revenues for an initial period of five years, and the federal government matched the sum, leading to an overall budget of close to $1 billion. Work initially focused on reducing the feature size of transistors on chips, technology that all of the partners would benefit from and that each could employ to compete in downstream product markets. While SEMATECH has evolved considerably since its founding, the pre-competitive R&D phase cemented U.S. leadership at a crucial time.

A quantitative study conducted by the National Academies found that SEMATECH member companies [lowered their R&D spending](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/5707/chapter/14#87:~:text=Sematech%20induces%20member%20firms%20to%20lower%20their%20R%26D%20spending.%20This%20suggests%20that%20Sematech%20allows%20more%20sharing%20and%20less%20duplication%20of%20research) after joining the consortia. Critics might say this proves government subsidies replace funding that industry would have made themselves, but the evidence indicates that this reduction was due to increased sharing of information and therefore less duplication of work.

As the consortia started demonstrating value for its members, the government began withdrawing its funding, and by 1997 Sematech became fully privately funded. As another National Academies study [put it](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/10677/chapter/13#275:~:text=At%20the%20end%20of%20the%20day%20the%20only%20absolutely%20certain%20thing%20about%20SEMATECH%20is%20that%20a%20substantial%20portion%20of%20its%20member%20companies%20must%20have%20found%20it%20to%20be%20of%20net%20value%2C%20having%20actually%20run%20the%20experiment%20of%20ending%20public%20subsidy%20and%20finding%20that%20they%E2%80%94its%20consumers%E2%80%94continued%20to%20buy%20its%20output.):

> At the end of the day, the only absolutely certain thing about SEMATECH is that a substantial portion of its member companies must have found it to be of net value, having actually run the experiment of ending public subsidy and finding that they—its consumers—continued to buy its output.

**Case #2: Manufacturing USA**

[Manufacturing USA](https://www.manufacturingusa.com/) is a network of sixteen institutes that develop and commercialize emerging manufacturing technologies. Each institute is an R&D consortium sponsored by the Department of Commerce, Defense, or Energy, and co-funded with academic and private sector partners. The network was established by the _Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014_. In 2021, Manufacturing USA Institutes worked with **2,300 member organizations** (63% were manufacturers) to conduct **708 R&D** projects across photonics, biomanufacturing, advanced robotics, and more.

[https://www.manufacturingusa.com/pages/manufacturing-usa-brand](https://www.manufacturingusa.com/pages/manufacturing-usa-brand)

Manufacturing USA’s [program mechanics](https://www.manufacturingusa.com/reports/2022-manufacturing-usa-highlights-report) contains valuable lessons for other R&D consortiums, such as:

- In 2021, the program leveraged $127 million in federal funds to attract **$354 million** in funds from state, federal and pandemic funds, and private funds.
- **Workforce development**. In 2021, the program engaged more than **90,000 students, workers and teachers** in advanced manufacturing workforce development and training
- **Emphasis on small manufacturers.** 72% of the manufacturers in the program are small companies (less than 500 employees).
- **Frequently gathering member input** via satisfaction [surveys](https://www.manufacturingusa.com/reports/advanced-manufacturing-innovation-institutes-report-technology-progress-and-members-report) of member organizations.

## Potential pitfalls

The United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) was established by the Department of Energy (DOE), electric utility companies, battery developers, and the three largest US automakers—Chrysler, Ford, and GM—in 1991 to accelerate EV battery development. Phase I, from 1991 to 1996, focused on six major battery systems and Phase II, from 1996 to 2000, will focus on three of the original six that showed promise: nickel metal hydride, lithium-ion, and lithium-polymer systems. The consortium invested $189 million in Phase I, with DOE and private industry splitting the funding 50-50. Phase II funding is expected to be $106 million, with 45% provided by the DOE and the rest coming from industry.

The consortium achieved mixed results according to a 1998 [review](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/6196) by the National Research Council at the request of the DOE’s Office of Advanced Automotive Technologies. While USABC made significant progress, it also suffered from unrealistic timelines and bureaucratic red tape. Some projects were delayed because of the logistics of setting up the consortium and the time required to establish operating procedures. USABC decided to terminate some projects early because of their lack of progress toward meeting objectives.
