## Key things to know

- Academia and Silicon Valley have very distinct ecosystems. The former is structured for domain experts to spend a decade+ studying questions that may not have [obvious practical applications](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/library/UsefulnessHarpers.pdf), whereas the latter is structured for hustlers who can build and iterate products quickly. In the most simplified version of archetypal comparisons, it’s the PhD vs. the dropout.
- Both cultures produce world-class talent with different strengths and weaknesses, but in a world that increasingly facing challenges like global pandemics, climate change, food and energy insecurity, and geopolitical uncertainty, it becomes increasingly necessary to empower those with deep domain expertise to commercialize their research.
- Building the next billion-dollar marketplace, B2B SaaS platform, or consumer app will not solve the world’s most important problems, nor is it enough to maintain a technological advantage over geopolitical rivals. This isn’t to say those companies aren’t important. Rather, we should teach the best practices learned from them to the hard scientific and engineering problems that have historically not made it out of academic labs.
- Example programs that have tried to address this gap include the [Activate Fellowship](https://www.activate.org/fellowship) (two-year full-time fellowship for entrepreneurial scientists), DARPA’s [Embedded Entrepreneurship Initiative](https://eei.darpa.mil/#impact) (connects DARPA program managers with commercial advisors), [NSF’s Innovation Corps](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/i-corps) (teaches entrepreneurship to academics with project-based learning), and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s [Cyclotron Road program](https://cyclotronroad.lbl.gov/) (which partners with Activate).

## Success case study

[The Activate Fellowship](https://www.activate.org/fellowship) is a non-profit fellowship program that provides two-year, full-time support for scientists to bring their research to market. Of all the previously mentioned programs, Activate is the most involved, intense, and successful. Some of the benefits it offers to fellows include:

- **************Dedicated funding for two years**************: Fellows receive an annual living stipend between $80-$110K. Each project receives $100K in guaranteed funding and access to at least $100K in additional capital if needed.
- ********************************Peer community:******************************** Activate Fellows build their products alongside other fellows. The program has been running for nearly eight years and has generated nine cohorts, permitting fellows to get plugged into a deep alumni network. The other mentioned programs do not have the intimate community dimension offered by Activate.
- ************************Deep network:************************ Activate Fellows receive access to top scientists, investors, corporates, and entrepreneurs across academia, technology hubs, and government labs. Some of these network connections even become fellows’ early employees, co-founders, or investors.
- ****************************************Research facilities****************************************: Fellows have access to research tools, equipment, and facilities at world-class facilities while retaining IP rights.
- ************Mentorship and startup curriculum:************ The Activate team meets with fellows one-on-one to develop execution roadmaps and make relevant connections. They also teach fellows about startup skills that academics typically do not have, such as sales, marketing, and product development.

Since its inception in 2015, Activate has [accepted](https://www.activate.org/impact) 188 fellows out of more than 2,500 applications. These fellows have gone on to create over 1,300 jobs and raise $1.3 billion in follow-on funding, with fellows raising an average of $6M during their fellowship. An example of a recent success is Activate Cohort 2018 Fellows Tim Latimer and Jack Norbeck, who founded Fervo Energy. In July 2023, the Fervo team [announced](https://twitter.com/TimMLatimer/status/1681304496234991620) they successfully built and field-tested the world’s first commercial-scale electricity generation using geothermal energy.

A few themes about Activate’s operating philosophy stood out from studying the (limited) publicly available resources about the organization:

- **They are extremely fellow-centric.** Fellows are at the heart of everything they do, from their community and educational programming to the fact that they don’t take any equity and actively work with fellows to retain 100% ownership of intellectual property.
- **************************************************************************They were founded with the federal lab DNA, giving them a unique talent pipeline into the national science ecosystem.************************************************************************** Activate was born out of the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and from day one they have been deeply plugged into the national labs, federal science agencies (DARPA, DOE, etc), and other frontier science organizations that most traditional Silicon Valley entities typically never engage with. Full list [here](https://www.activate.org/fellowship).
- ******************************************************************Intentional community design.****************************************************************** The Activate team has carefully designed the program structure to create intimate peer networks. They offer four in-person hubs in Berkeley, Boston, Houston, and New York, and one virtual hub for anyone in the US called Activate Anywhere. Each community has a dedicated Managing Director and local team that provides one-on-one support to the hub. As a result, fellows on the same team can only join one hub and are highly encouraged to participate in community-led activities. They also require fellows at in-person hubs to relocate or commute twice a month for in-person education and networking events.
- ************************************************************************Focus on their circle of competency.************************************************************************ Over time, Activate has developed a strong support system for researchers in agriculture, buildings, chemicals, electricity, computing, manufacturing, transportation, and defense. They are extremely selective with health industry projects and explicitly do not take fellows developing pharmaceuticals, stating “We simply do not have the right support system or sponsors to support such products.”
- ************************************************************Independent non-profit status enables autonomy and flexibility.************************************************************ Activate’s legal structure enables them to move fast, take risks, and experiment freely, similar to what we wrote about In-Q-Tel in [Public Venture Capital Funds](Public%20Venture%20Capital%20Funds%206fc42cbaa07247f5ac475a769be75195.md). As we also see with DARPA (covered in [Moonshot Institutions](Moonshot%20Institutions%208a6af497ccbe46be9b36d16160ce9f47.md)), lack of government oversight is key for these sorts of programs.
