## Contributors

[AJ Kourabi](https://www.ajkourabi.com/) is an engineering physics student at McMaster University, interested in scientific public goods, metascience, and philanthropy. He has previously interned at Convergent Research, started a micro-grants program for engineering students, and wrote a paper for the Canadian Government on building a Canadian ARPA-H. He most recently interned at Schmidt Futures, the philanthropic venture of Eric and Wendy Schmidt.

## Key things to know

- Scientific roadmapping is a process for mapping the constraints of a problem with clearly defined, measurable goals and potential workarounds for those constraints. It is a form of guided discovery or purposeful exploration.
- Explicitly detailing barriers to progress provides explicit answers for allocators of capital and talent asking “Where should I invest?” This exercise is particularly effective at surfacing neglected problems or questions.
- Key outputs of science roadmapping include:
    - Progress made so far on the specified problem
    - Major roadblocks
    - Key questions the field is **************************(and is not)************************** working on, and why
    - Ways to unlock bottlenecks and clear paths forward
    - Who is working on what, and if there are coordination problems that need solving
- Well-defined roadmaps use a taxonomy that is mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustible ([MECE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MECE_principle)). One can think of these paths as non-overlapping tiles that collectively cover the space of possibilities.

## Case Study

The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) is set of [documents](https://www.semiconductors.org/resources/2003-international-technology-roadmap-for-semiconductors-itrs/) coordinated by industry experts. The 15 year roadmap was devised in 2003, coordinating developments in photolithography, etching, metal deposition, and more. This highlighted a line of technological dependencies, and allowed companies and research institutions to plan their work around technology expected to be available.  

In 2013, neuroscience research also benefitted from similar coordination. The [Physical principles for scalable neural recording](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2013.00137/full) paper was released, specifying key rates of neural recording and and their respective volumes. The paper outlines principles in physics (e.g. optical measurement, electrical, magnetic resonance, and molecular modalities) and works backwards to highlight necessary technological dependencies. 

## Potential pitfalls

- **Institutional bias** Roadmapping by a single organization may impose a dominant institutional view.

- **Planning purgatory** By definition, the exercise is examining a problem that is not discretely defined, measured, or predicted. To roadmap effectively, there may be high coordination costs that take away from simply funding projects directly.
