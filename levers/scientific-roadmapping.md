## About the co-author

AJ Kourabi is an engineering student at McMaster University, interested in scientific public goods, metascience, and philanthropy. He has previously interned at Convergent Research, started a micro grants program for engineering students, and wrote a paper for the Canadian Government on building a Canadian ARPA-H. He is currently interning at Schmidt Futures.

## Key things to know

_Definition and Significance_

A scientific roadmap is a process that aims to map the constraints of a problem with a clearly defined, measurable goal. This Lever aims to work backwards from the solution using a predetermined taxonomy that is mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustible ([MECE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MECE_principle)). This “backchaining” needs to be logical and deliberate, with well defined limits on each path. One can think of these paths as non overlapping tiles that collectively cover the space of possibilities.

This Lever allows for the generation of solutions beyond what might be conceived of traditionally, and can be thought of as a form of guided discovery or purposeful exploration. Key products of this exercise also include:

- Progress made so far on the specified problem
- Major roadblocks
- Key questions the field is **(and is not)** working on, and why
- Ways to unlock bottlenecks and clear paths forward

This form of roadmapping aims to deliberately unlock solutions that are not prey to institutional incentives. In essence, this tool allows for a path to be charted toward shovel-ready ideas, and then the appropriate institutional mechanism can be fitted. These institutions could be Focused Research Organisations, ARPA’s, Academic Labs, Industry projects, etc.

Roadmaps often include a variety of expert’s input, to assess specific cases and dimensions. Thinking holistically about what solutions exist, even if they can not be built, also allows for exploration that may provide insight difficult to procure otherwise.

## When to use

Scientific roadmapping can be utilised within the scope of a clear and measurable problem, and is difficult to employ otherwise.

_Success case study_

Measuring mouse brain activity at a specified rate in a specified volume ([example](Scientific%20Roadmapping%206a2b9c340a9445fdb50ac3d6a20ff125.md)).

After specifying the key rates of recording, and within what volume, t[his paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2013.00137/full) takes the approach of working backwards through outlining principles in physics (e.g optical measurement, electrical, magnetic resonance, and molecular modalities). In going through this process and understanding the physical principles at the limit allows for insight into novel solutions – essentially asking the question – what is stopping us from reaching these current limits?

There are other accompanying questions that such a roadmap may uncover?

- Are there approaches or mechanisms that we should be doing to solve this problem that we are currently not?
  - If yes, why
- Through mapping who is working on what, are there coordination problems that need solving?

Indeed, Scientific roadmaps have often been explicitly done to solve coordination within burgeoning fields.

For example, the process of making integrated circuits is complicated and requires specialised operations like photolithography and etching. This specialisation poses potential difficulties for companies aiming to release products related to manufacturing, since it may not be useful if other needed steps are not available yet.

To solve this coordination and timing problem, a 15 year technology roadmap was devised in the 2000’s aiming to outline timelines and directions of research. This roadmap proved a success as another iteration was established in 2016.

## Potential pitfalls

If a problem has outcomes that can not be concretely measured or predicted, roadmapping may be difficult due to the inability of legible back chaining.
