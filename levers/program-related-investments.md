## Key things to know

- Program-related investments (PRIs) are a type of investment made by private foundations in service of their philanthropic mission. Unlike grants, which are one-time donations, PRIs are investments that allow foundations to recover their invested capital and deploy these "recycled" dollars again and again.
- To be classified as a PRI, an investment must meet three requirements [specified by the IRS](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/private-foundations/program-related-investments):
    - the primary purpose is to accomplish one or more of the foundation's charitable goals
    - the production of income or appreciation of property is not a significant purpose
    - influencing legislation or taking part in political campaigns on behalf of candidates is not a purpose
- PRIs count towards [the 5% minimum payout](https://learning.candid.org/resources/knowledge-base/payout/) required for private foundations annually and can take forms such as loans, loan guarantees, and equity investments.
- In addition to improving foundations' capital efficiency, PRIs act as catalytic capital that de-risks mission-aligned projects so that other investors (including government and for-profit companies) feel confident making follow-on investments. PRIs can also help recipients develop financial discipline and planning skills since the investment must be repaid — typically under concessionary rates/terms.
- PRIs have been used to support a wide range of causes including affordable housing, community development, health clinics, educational initiatives, and sustainability projects.

## Case study

[Prime Coalition](https://www.primecoalition.org/) is a nonprofit that was founded in 2014 to "[support market-driven climate solutions](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/azolla-ventures-launched-by-prime-coalition-to-deploy-catalytic-capital-debuts-new-239-million-blended-fund-to-support-overlooked-climate-solutions-301876286.html) that have massive potential but are overlooked by traditional finance." It was founded upon the idea that PRIs, and the broader trend of [catalytic capital investing](https://www.impactterms.org/catalytic-capital/), could act as essential tools for channeling some of the billions of dollars of annually distributed philanthropic capital towards high-impact energy innovation.  

Historically, many of the most ambitious climate-tech companies have been neglected by mainstream investors due to technical risk, high capital requirements (e.g. for hardware companies or startups with large R&D costs), and long time horizons. Prime's team believes these "moonshot" companies are crucial for solving critical climate and energy problems facing the world, and that creative funding models can provide them with capital that makes the difference between failure and major breakthroughs.  

As of December 2023, Prime has deployed over $300 million of philanthropic and catalytic capital toward scalable solutions to climate change. Its investments have supported innovative companies working on [fusion batteries](https://www.primecoalition.org/investee-library/avalanche-energy), [synthetic biology](https://www.primecoalition.org/investee-library/microbyre), [novel electric motors](https://www.primecoalition.org/investee-library/c-motive-technologies), [cheap and sustainable lithium extraction](https://www.primecoalition.org/investee-library/lilac-solutions), [carbon capture](https://www.primecoalition.org/investee-library/charm-industrial), and more.  

Each investment Prime makes undergoes careful diligence and screening to ensure it passes three criteria:
- *Impact:* the company must have the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
- *Additionality:* the company must be unlikely to be able to raise sufficient financial support from “conventional” investors (i.e. philanthropic support is needed)
- *Commercial Potential:* the company must have a high potential for achieving commercial success at scale

## Potential pitfalls

- Foundations used to making grants may lack the necessary processes, structures, employees, and expertise required for PRIs (including due diligence, deal structures, and portfolio management).
- The IRS does not clearly define how to demonstrate that a PRI is being made to support a foundation's charitable purpose, and therefore legal advisory is typically required.
