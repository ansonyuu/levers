## Key things to know

- There are a few institutions whose mandate is to achieve outsized scientific and technological; breakthroughs. Some are standalone organizations whose mandate is to push the technological frontier for particular domains, such as [Actuate/Prime Coalition](https://www.primecoalition.org/library/actuate-climate-joins-forces-with-prime-coalition) [](https://actuateinnovation.org/)(climate/energy), [Wellcome Leap](https://wellcome.org/what-we-do/our-work/wellcome-leap) (health), [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/) (software), NobelReach ([emerging tech](https://noblereachfoundation.org/)). Others are part of a parent organization and seek to increase innovation in areas within their parent organization’s domain. These are often called “moonshot” or “innovation” departments, and some examples include Apple’s Exploratory Design Group, GoogleX, DARPA (although some might argue DARPA’s unique autonomy effectively renders it a separate organization outside the Department of Defense), or historically, Bell Labs, XeroxPARC, and [Skunk Works](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/lockheed-martin).
- [Historical themes](https://progress.institute/how-do-we-make-an-entrepreneurial-state/#:~:text=certain%20themes%20that%20repeat%20across%20case%20studies) from government institutions with outsized innovative output such as ARPA/DARPA, MITI, and Vinnovaad include the importance of attracting elite talent into public service, a consistent and large funding stream, lack of red tape, and tolerance for risk and failure.
- We used the term “institution” instead of “department” for this lever to highlight that regardless of whether the organization is independent or part of a larger bureaucracy, it needs to be ********************************************functionally independent******************************************** and should not be thought of as ‘just another department********************************************.’******************************************** The more rules, norms, and existing ways of thinking that are implanted in the moonshot institution, the less able people on the team can think boldly and differently.
- The fundamental challenge for any bureaucracy—corporate, government, or otherwise—is achieving [agile stability](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/publications/2019/dec/innovation-bureaucracies-how-agile-stability-creates-entrepreneurial-state): maintaining what works while growing the flexibility to evolve. This is notoriously difficult, for as organizations grow, entrenched hierarchies and risk aversion inhibit organizations from taking risky bets. Innovation departments can be the organizational antidote to combating cultural stagnation.

## Success case study

Ben Reinhardt’s case study “[Why does DARPA work?](https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw)” is the most in-depth public breakdown of the levers behind DARPA’s success. ARPAnet (Internet precursor), GPS, computer mouse, TCP/IP, PAL (Siri precursor), lasers, and autonomous vehicles all came out of DARPA programs, just to name a few mildly important outcomes.

DARPA is centered around its program managers, a group of ~130 individuals with 4-5 year appointments to pursue a singular, ambitious vision. DARPA does not conduct in-house research, so PMs hire external orgs—university labs, private companies, etc.—to execute different parts of their vision. Each program can cost anywhere from <$1M to tens of millions, and DARPA PMs have high autonomy in deciding where to deploy capital.

I encourage you to read Ben’s post for his full analysis, but here are some interesting tidbits:

> [Opacity is important to DARPA’s outlier success.](https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#opacity_is_important_to_darpa%E2%80%99s_outlier_success) Congress and the DoD have little default oversight into how a PM is spending money and running a program. Opacity removes incentives to go for easy wins or to avoid being criticized by external forces. Of course, opacity can also be abused in too many ways to list, so it’s important to ask: How does DARPA incentivize people not to abuse opacity? DARPA’s small size and flat structure enable peer pressure to work in positive ways.
> 

> [DARPA Program managers have a tenure of four to five years.](https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_program_managers_have_a_tenure_of_four_to_five_years) This transience is important for many reasons. Transience can inculcate PMs against the temptation to play it safe or play power games because there’s only one clear objective – make the program work. You’re out regardless of success or failure. Regular program manager turnover means that there is also turnover in ideas.
> 

> [DARPA is incredibly flexible with who it hires to be program managers.](https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#darpa_is_incredibly_flexible_with_who_it_hires_to_be_program_managers) There are legal provisions in place that let DARPA bypass normal government hiring rules and procedures. Hiring flexibility is important because PMs are the sort of people who are in high demand, so they may be unwilling to jump through hoops. Bureaucracies ensure consistency through rules – minimal bureaucracy means there are no safeguards against hiring a terrible program manager so the principle that ‘A players hire A players and B players hire C players’ is incredibly important

Licklider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider) is a paragon here. He brought together all the crazy people interested in human-focused computing. On top of that,  he also helped create the first computer science lab groups. PMs also build networks of people in different classes of organizations – government, academia, startups, and large companies. These connections smooth the path for technologies to go from the lab to the shelf.

Another successful example of an innovation institution that lived within a larger parent organization is Netflix. The Institute for Progress [wrote](https://progress.institute/how-do-we-make-an-entrepreneurial-state/) about the reasons for its success:

> For the first decade of its existence, Netflix was essentially a DVD-by-mail company. Not content with this business model, and intrigued by the early success of YouTube, leadership at the company started investigating the possibility of streaming video directly over the internet, and launched a streaming product in 2007. To do this, they set up a new division that was somewhat isolated from the traditional processes and metrics used to govern the rest of the firm. According to one history of the company, the DVD executives were even [kicked out](https://thestrategystory.com/2020/09/13/netflix-pivoting-business-model/) of certain management meetings to make sure the streaming division had room to grow.

This separate streaming division eventually grew to become the modern Netflix. Netflix competed with itself internally across product verticals rather than let an outside competitor beat it to the new market. **But for this new team to have success, they needed to be able to pull from a different talent pool, be judged by a different set of metrics, and productively interface with the rest of the company without kickstarting a turf war. In other words, they needed a high degree of institutional autonomy.**

## Potential pitfalls

Corporations like Google have attempted moonshot labs with mixed results. In his mini-essay “*Most DARPA clones start too big or with heavy process*,” Ben Reinhardt explains:

> DARPA started off small and informal. For years it was less than ten people.

Starting too big often *causes* heavy process. People always spend money for a purpose, so the more money there is up front, the more expectations there are attached to it. One failure mode is that funding entity doesn’t trust a low-track record organization and requires heavy process to create assurance that the money will be well-spent.

Starting large makes opacity hard, and [opacity is important to DARPA’s outlier success](https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw#opacity_is_important_to_darpa%E2%80%99s_outlier_success). Starting large with large expectations and scrutiny makes it tough to execute on things that seem stupid. A spotlight also encourages organizations to work on things that seem sexy which makes it hard to generate true outlier output. Remember: if you know it’s easy to shut something down it’s easier to start and the opposite is true as well.

Culture and trust takes time to build. A large organization either needs culture and trust or process to keep everybody aligned so if you start big *without* heavy process it will just lead to a shitshow. As far as I can tell, this point and the previous one is roughly what happened with [Google ATAP](https://atap.google.com/).
