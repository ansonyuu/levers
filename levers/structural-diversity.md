## Contributors

[Dr. Corin Wagen](https://corinwagen.github.io/public/main/index.html) is a computational/organic chemist who is co-founding a startup in computational chemistry. He recently completed a PhD from Harvard University, where he studied the development and mechanism of selective catalytic reactions. He writes about scientific institutions, progress, and governance [here](https://cwagen.substack.com/). This page is a summary of his [post on Structural Diversity](https://cwagen.substack.com/p/20221026_structural_diversityhtml).

## Key things to know

- Basic science is typically performed by academic labs containing 5–30 people, overseen by a single investigator, with a budget of about few million per year. The vast majority of researchers are undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs, all of whom only stay in the lab for a few years (typically 2–4 years for postdocs and 4–7 years for graduate students), meaning that there’s a steady attrition of institutional knowledge.
- This limits the research that can be performed. “Deep” skills requiring more than a year or two of training are tricky, because the time it takes to acquire skills comes directly out of the time they can be doing productive research. Additionally, certain skill sets (e.g. software engineering) command such a premium that it’s [difficult to attract such people to academia](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9GweYgHABZAjH6T6f/). Specialized instrumentation is another challenge: a given lab might only have the budget for a few high-end instruments, implying that its projects must be chosen accordingly.
- Most truly groundbreaking projects are “too big” for a single academic lab; many fields have been picked clean of projects with low enough barriers to entry to make them accessible to academics. Greater structural diversity among institutions pursuing fundamental science would bring previously inaccessible findings within reach. This could take many forms:
  - More roles for staff scientists, software engineers, and other non-student researcher positions.
  - Allowing for greater flexibility in the structure of labs (i.e. multiple professors within the same lab).
  - [Giving department heads more power](https://www.freaktakes.com/p/how-karl-compton-believed-a-research), thus making departments more like a single, large-scale organization working towards a single goal.
  - [Focused research organizations](https://www.convergentresearch.org/about-fros) and similar large-scale undertakings.

## Case study

There are many examples where large organizations were able to produce big advances inaccessible to their smaller counterparts: LIGO, the Large Hadron Collider, Brian Nosek’s Center for Open Science, and the Human Genome Project. More recently, research-oriented organizations like DeepMind and OpenAI have achieved massive breakthroughs in AI/ML, largely based on their ability to apply resources far beyond what any academic group can [bring to bear](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06035?s=03).

Nevertheless, the significant expenditures demanded by these efforts make failure more costly: the “creative destruction” implicit in the tenure system naturally prunes poor achievers in a way that’s harder to scale to massive research enterprises. Additionally, most scientists are poor (and untrained) managers, making the question of program leadership challenging.

There remain plenty of areas where academic monoculture harms progress: in Elliot Hershberg’s [essay](https://newscience.org/how-software-in-the-life-sciences-actually-works-and-doesnt-work/) on software development in computational biology, he recounts how the presence of actual software engineers in academia is “a minor miracle, like a two-headed calf.” Most academic software is written by poorly trained graduate students, making it unreliable and hard to maintain, leading to a preponderance of bad tools that inhibit scientific research. Despite the fantastic results that have been achieved when Silicon Valley talent is directed to scientific problems (discussed further in Hershberg’s essay), the structure of academia makes this an uphill battle to organize and fund. Organizations focused on scientific software development, with the resources to do this properly, could fix this problem and catalyze further progress in computational life sciences.
