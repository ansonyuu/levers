## Key things to know

- Advanced market commitments (AMC) are binding contracts to purchase products once they are developed and meet certain criteria, such as quality and price.
- What differentiates an AMC from other binding purchase agreements like [Advance purchase agreement](https://www.notion.so/Advance-purchase-agreement-6592eb0fcb9f403799eac614c1cfc8aa) is that it is an open bid that can be won by anyone.
- By guaranteeing a market for the product once it’s successfully developed, AMCs derisk R&D for products that otherwise lack sufficient market demand.

## When to use

Particularly useful in addressing market failures and areas where private investment is limited, such as public health or high-risk technologies. For example, AMCs are often used to develop vaccines for diseases prevalent in developing nations, as free markets don’t incentivize developing complex drugs for the poorest nations.

## Reasons for success and example

The product should have clearly definable specs and be achievable in the medium term (2-4y).

In 2007, five countries and the Gates Foundation pledged $1.5 billion to fund a pilot AMC for a [pneumococcal vaccine](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26775). It was a smashing success, immunizing 150 million children and saving the lives of 700,000 people since [distributing](https://www.nber.org/digest/apr20/price-guarantee-spurred-vaccine-development-poor-nations) the first doses in 2010.

## Causes of failure and example

The [time inconsistency](https://www.cairn.info/revue-d-economie-politique-2019-1-page-1.htm?ref=doi#:~:text=is%20often%20called-,Time%20Inconsistency,-%2C%20as%20first%20introduced) problem is the risk of payment denial from the AMC issuer in honoring their purchase commitment. If the issuer is a government that changes over time, a different administration or budget cuts may invalidate the AMC, even if the contract is legally binding.

The 2004 US Bioshield Project sought to develop and stockpile medical countermeasures (MCMs) against bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. A $5.6 billion AMC was launched to incentivize private sector participation in developing novel MCMs. It [triggered](https://www.cairn.info/revue-d-economie-politique-2019-1-page-1.htm?ref=doi#:~:text=triggered%20nearly%20no%20interest%20from%20the%20private%20sector) little interest from the private sector. One reason was that the funding ($5.6B over 10 years) was insufficient to justify developing MCMs for rare or potential biological threats, as such products may never have commercial viability.
