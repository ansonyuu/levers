## Key things to know

_Definition and Significance_

- Many countries have designated visas for attracting entrepreneurs or high-skilled labor. Examples include:
  - The UK’s [Startup](https://www.gov.uk/start-up-visa) and [Innovator Founder](https://www.gov.uk/innovator-founder-visa) or [Startup](https://www.gov.uk/start-up-visa) visas allow immigrants to start an “innovative business” in the UK as long as they’re endorsed by a university or organization with a history of supporting UK entrepreneurs (e.g. venture capital firm)
  - Singapore’s [EntrePass](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/entrepass) allows foreign-born entrepreneurs to found or operate a business that is venture-backed or possesses “innovative technologies”
  - Other examples include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and (infamously) China’s [Thousand Talents Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Talents_Plan)
