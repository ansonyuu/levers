## Key things to know

_Definition and Significance_

- Memes “convey the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation” — Richard Dawkins, **\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\***The Selfish Gene.**\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\*** In other words, memes are encapsulations of culture that spread virally from mind to mind.
- The most powerful memes are simple, concrete, and existential. They shape culture, politics, economics—and even how technology is built. Bitcoin
- As a technology writer [reflected](https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/katherine-boyle#:~:text=Though%20he%20could,talent%20and%20capital.) on Marc Andreesen’s famous meme \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***Software is Eating the World\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***:
  > Though he could not have known it then, Andreessen’s phrase came to describe and drive the decade’s tech boom. It was invoked, remixed, and repeated until it became a kind of proof in and of itself, something fundamentally true about the world. Why would the startup beat the incumbent? Why would an analog industry be remade in bytes and bits? Because software is eating the world, of course.
  > It is hard to estimate the value of a meme like Andreessen’s. How many future entrepreneurs were emboldened by those words? How much incremental capital flowed toward the private market, subtly scripted by that sense of promise? Steve Jobs famously remarked that the “most powerful person in the world is the storyteller.” In just a few words, Andreessen had crafted a narrative of remarkable power, capable of organizing talent and capital.
