## Contributors

## Key things to know

- Something that makes the Bay Area a special place for innovation is the ubiquity of co-living houses, maker spaces, hackathons, and other high-trust places where people can freely exchange ideas. When done right, these spaces strike the right balance of being informal enough for people to feel comfortable expressing heretical thoughts, but institutionalized enough where formal community structures exist (such as a physical meeting point or communication channels). Spaces that strike this balance well are virtually nonexistent in DC policy circles, which is a big problem for many areas, but especially in my world of science and technology policy.
- No matter who you are in the federal government, you always represent someone else.
- Complex technical topics require intellectual humility, honest exchange
- According to their 1921 prospectus, they imagined a place “where talk has no fetters and where exchanged opinion leads to clarity.”
- Two Indian Senators in 1929 thought there was too much vitriol so started congressional country club for families of Members and business of Washington to build common ground. Any president get honoree membership for life. Most congressional members used to join but now it’s expensive so most join after they retire and become lobbyists. Presidents are members for life
- They said the club started as a high-trust place for Members to talk about difficult issues in a casual setting, but over time it’s gotten so expensive that the only Members who join are those who retire and become lobbyists.
