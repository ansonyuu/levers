## Case study

## Failure case study

he Grain Belt Express transmission line through Missouri was initially rejected by the state Public Service Com-mission in 2015. Even after it was eventually approved in 2019 and granted the power of eminent domain, the state legislature has repeatedly attempted to limit or eliminate that power, which would kill the project. The New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee deniedan application for the proposed Northern Pass trans-mission project in 2018. The Rock Island Clean Line through Iowa was stalled when the state legislature made eminent domain land acquisition for transmis-sion much more difficult. The Plains and Eastern Clean Line was delayed when, in 2011, the Arkansas Public Service Commission denied its application to be con-sidered a “public utility.” ([link](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/20230213_CRM_Patnaik_Permitting_FINAL.pdf))

Precarious how it removes local and stsate authority to block transmission line projects. May genuinely be quite harmful. Land acquisition cases can be extremely unpopular
